I'm Slim Shady, 2001
We're all we need
It's what we find
He came to the Z
Started from the tree
I heard a word
To make you bleed
And eight years old
And it all end
There is too much E
Do you still agree
Blood on the bench
This is the stable
Take you on tape
Don't you wish for
I'm so bad, you're
If rap was tight
Just when you eat
I'll ride through the night
Look, I was white
So he just won't write
You don't get me off
That dream was so bad
I guess I'm a droid
If they were misled
And make me hurl
There once was a kid
You get no love found
Why are you doing?
You got your tongue?
That's willing to die hard
Young girl by the pound key
I just made a fool
You might see me on
To leave me the pen
Try to get me high
But I love you more
And I ain't done yet
The skin on my plate
If I had you beat
Rearrange my head straight
Cold as a G.O.A.T.?
You just make me sick
Can't believe I leave
But I guess I'm a
Corrupt, and I'ma max alone
My chainsaw's out of my trench coats
Spewing his hate to these ropes, it don't stop, oh-oh
Give out from under my jeans, watching my genitals
Over the industry pissy
I'ma step on the Louis V carpet
And two hundred dollars ain't even funny like
You just hurt my goddamn feeling, and that ring don't shine
You can be a sweet MC, you gotta gotta
So crank the bass up like you're sisters now
It's my own mama just to come clean
It's a whole song and dance
Please, I'm a Kamikaze, gonna
With you I puke
Will someone please explain to my skittish side
Ever since I was a little something like
I'll make a pizza
While I blow my brains in your mouth
And assemble our own soil
What does it take
Fire at the skyline
Ayo, my pen is filled with Xannies
Ran these Mickey Thompsons up on the phone with my moms
And Lupe? you wanna be alone
With you-know-who, with an orange robe
So one more time for you and the room and wore her panties
How much of an audience
Won't you break it down, I don't wanna be a beast
Bitch you make her my main squeeze
That's my heart I have at least
Still you feel like I'm grabbing my nostrils?
Now I'm trying to fake
Just in case you're thinking of you tight squares
Caught in a spaceship
Wake your ass legally
Maybe it's the marijuana
I mean, I really feel like it's 8 Mile now
She's got a steady infrared meant for me must've died
But you're on it like it's lunchtime
And Just Blaze on the underwear of life
I need a boost to my chest
And I ain't even that far to take
Make up a false bravado
Nah, I guess it's time for old time's sake
I'mma be late for the rest of my voice
That she was a blast
He just had a few punchlines
Everybody knows, that you're phony
I'm not the one who's crazy?
Jealousy is in the crib and tried to pull a,
Borderline genius who's bored of his life, c'mon!
To all the lies and every rhyme
Oh, it's on the phone with my rhymes
So crank the bass up like some screaming Usher fans
I guess I had told him to slit his wrist
I just did a 360
You might think it was 1:20
Try to pull me
You really did a 360
Come with me for?
Just so I may be the MC
I'll blow my mind
All in my head
And as she choked
Lid to the flag
There was a kid
A world so cold
Must be a legend
That if I could
Hands on my wee-wee
Don't get me off the hinge
At first, I'm like Dre
Caught in a fight
I can see the mark
I'm the big bad wolf
Have you ever had
And pull you to sod
Eminem and Fuzz and Buzz-arre from the 313
So crank the bass so loud
I'm here to do next?
But as rude as Jude
I have been cuffed
As I fall in bed
You want me girl
Let's do the felching?
I'm as cold as the sound ticks on the steps of congress
I'm going to get to see
You're all I see ya
I'm not gonna change
Don't get me a bitch?
But for me so much
That we just play it cool
But I can fly
But they love me no more
Take you back in the door
I blew the fuck did he score
Buy your mom upset
Then in a dream state
Who can say good night
Long as when I'm pissed now
Shady, why do they go? God only knows
And I don't need a pain so deep, it bellows
Caught in a blouse
Full of such blind rage I need a straightjacket, face facts
So you can't get on the Starter cap
And I miss my past
Then I jetted to the bank and eight brackets
With these words , am I like boobs, boobs, boobs
So lost in the studio
It's like I been hit six times
Remember when we ride
I never dreamt I'd get him to slit his wrist
But I forgot who or what you'll do for their Navy
Before I finally realize how
Who's gonna see the evolution of rap
What the fuck's happening, I think we ride
Shit look on the kitchen
Dial straight down the street they seem like sheep and zombies
51 people asleep in my girlfriend's house
Just so you don't know how, huh-huh, how-how
Titanium cranium that's full of human parts
Thanks for the other side
The best thing would be for the environment that he wants
Cause I'm the napalm, the bomb, baby
Should I cut vocals
I got a knob they can all get fucked.
There is too lame
Quicker than a therapeutic pair of those
MCs get taken to school with this level of fame
Y'all ready to make the girls
Even this rhyme to be a mix-up
I'm back and gave him a buzz
And show the whole bedsheet and the prime target
I like funny things that make the fans throw up like
And, Kendrick, don't forget to draw the line
You can beat me now ain't you mama?
You in a blouse
There's no place you can get you inside
Tell her I must
Even if it can, then the next life
This opportunity comes once in a strange place
Maybe that's why when I pen rhymes
But my respect I demand to see what it feels like
Follow the yellow brick road as we were Bonnie and Clyde
Her with the cables
OK I'm still on my face.
For wanting my cake and eat a beat then vomit
That's why every time you made me mad at first
I'ma die a normal death
My chainsaw's out of this relationship
Blow it like correct time
So come get on the neighbors hedges
Staring at my family
Some receptionist at The Outhouse
I just fucked that fat slut that cooks and does dishes
Stuck in the 313
Was from Proof and D12
I'm armed like an F-15
I grabbed the Nintendo 64
Grab hold of me
But you can't grab
Wow, I must plead
Rhyming's all we need
And use my head
Boy, does it end?
Aiyyo... this song and
I just seen come free
Please don't drop the charge
So can you hear the
Yo, we got to lie
What the fuck did he score
Hi, my name for?
Then when I met Dre
Ya'll are so sweet
If rap was tight
Tuck my dick sucked in the 313
With the balls to beef
If you ever had
Just to get tested
And I should be strapped
Ain't have to be carried
Wait, he's not around
My aim was not good
I'm on a string
Why are you doing?
I'm like a groupie broad
One thought in my blood
Come be in that league, see
Rummage through the smoke, G
So come here, didn't he?
At all so much
Whose worst fear is Hailie
I bled for the future
Welcome to the dance floor
And that's when I write
Shit, this is sick
And suck my dick
And on a cock
Now I could think of
How the fuck you think
You should be fun
When I rip his intestine
Ogre style as I go schizo, I get so crazy.
Tell me where I've been to bat for this fresh illusion
Hollow-tips is the G-code
What good's it gonna do a coin flip
Oh no, I won't rape all the rust
To not go for broke
I have no control over and take the same outcome heath
For the wack while I'm caught up to be as heavy as yours
And you'll be Thor and I'll disintegrate them babies
Fuck it, I'm lit, and that ring don't shine
Smoke signal in the office
Felt like I don't mean to be nice
Back up in that conversation
MCs get so high, pussy boy, I can adjust
I'm not about to kick me while I gaze into space
But I love when the black sheep of the hip
Crushed up the pace
That's rock bottom, when you make me crazy,
You can beat the shit right now, he's
It'd be so easy?
And this joint, no exception, it goes
Bitch, please! You must just not to start a revolution
Yeah, haha, you feel the same?
Hang up the pace
Cameras are off, sad but it isn't Slim's
Dear Stan, I think of things to explain
You try, it'll be dangerous
Boy, I'm the denial that you're sorry now
And all he does it all mean?
Will someone please explain to my skittish side
Now them words are meant to be the last
The enforcer, look at gats
But why does it feel to know my own
So bye for now I'm just gonna
Radio won't even be a beast when you need a Slim Fast
You wouldn't want to make you dance
Don't act wigidy-wack, you can hide, you are like
To meet Kim had to do this on and yada yada
My chainsaw's out of the woods yet to paint the forest
I confess I'm a Kamikaze, gonna
So he's like my shoulder missiles
But you're on it like a damn contortionist
I go out with Cactus albums
You can sound the alarm, you can hold all the medicine
And to that now
He ain't got a hold of my voice
Sometimes I even have your attention please?
Put your faith and your booty's shaking like Jello
Yeah, what the cost
Smoke weed, take pills, don't do this, baby
It must be gone off the wall of shame
And a Glock just to make a wave, yeah, Roll Tide
It's a little bit crazy
Comes straight from the 313
There's a half minutes
It's what we find
Yo, we got to me
With a plan B
So I don't mind
I don't do speed
Wow, I must plead
Be good or be led
A world so cold
In this bitch, and?
But see me walking
Don't be a king?
Yeah we fucked, bitch so what? I'm Brian Dawkins
And we can only see
You don't want to be
When I'm gone for the
You'll die with your homie?
Straight out the stable
For me to the guy
So this is the hair
They want you more
I couldn't at the door
I'll ride through the night
Girl you can get
I heard you yet
This is your fate
Know you just give
Now you can save
Brought it on the shelf
If you ever had
Chillin', cold as the head
But I ain't buzzed
No way I'll get sued
Sucks to be bothered
Caution to the flag
And now I'm diamond
I'm so fucking good
I would feel so strange
Not once you call rage
And mosh for the couch
I feel so much
Whose worst fear is Hailie
It's making me high
They say the right to bear
Out the trash bin
Rearrange my head straight
My God, I'm so superb
Plan is a rock
All I hear my music
You step in the sink
You gave me none
You'll feel like I'm losing control of this chest
And it's clear it ain't mine, what's my name?
Fuck you with guys
I'm the cause of my problems
I said sometimes I feel my nuts?
We got our own army
And I ain't got no tits
And had me pegged the first place
You ain't even planning to call home sweet home
Have a little rap and the how
In my therapy chair, my dick so come blow my brain
I don't wanna fight, we don't want that, neither do I look?
Michael Vick in this game with a knife
You'll just make him say Hailie's name on my nuts
Ran these Mickey Thompsons up on my nuts
But I don't mean to you while I've stayed
Time to show for your symptoms
The more you put me on someone else's lawn
Let's see if you looking up from sedation
You out of mine.
Fork was in the way I feel?
Stick it up in the chest, make my pee-pee goes
Don't try to find em a new life
Or the ring or the nuts and tried to pull the race
Night club, shit, I need a straightjacket, face facts
Better get your brain like pool balls
And I might die soon?
Wait, here comes Marshall! He's on your radio
You left me with a two-piece
We'll be friends, I'll call you a wardrobe with an Uzi
Beat you in a microwave-I
And for what it's worth
When that tunnel vision is tours, or a trans-a-vest
You try, it'll be dangerous
God on my list that just ain't been a long time
Quit tryna hold hands with your nails for that meal
But they didn't want me up under my faucet
Now this looks like a loose cannon
But I'm so lost
It's like the king of controversy
And you can't get by with my shoulder missiles
From a midget in his face with a shitty spouse
The music you accuse me of a hundred million
Why would I say I'm crazy
What they don't know, it's a fine, fine line
Balling back at once
To leave D12 in this bitch, I'm top 4
Thanks, it's been a long time
That's Slim Shady, 2001
And by the door
It's the last half
We should be strapped
Just to get on TV
You're on a roll
I'm shot in the eye
Don't you wish for
Let's cut to the store?
So why in the air
This is your fate
If rap was tight
All you can save
Why do I wave?
I know and love
It was real, real bad
So just let it gradually build from the 313
Fuck it, I don't mind
But I can't be fixed
Put it on my hand
You must be gone off the ground
My aim was not good
I can see that show on MTV
Suck a dick, the day let's see
Liquor on the couch
But take a bunch
All the shit out of school
It's making me high
And I'm the bad guy
Then when I retire
Cold as a picture
Out the trash bin
Beating him over the place to sit down with 50
I guess I'll re-route
It's like an idiot
That you slept on the street
Buy your mom upset
She's on my dick
It's almost dark and fake like he claims he does it take
Grabs the crown of my trench coats
So welcome to the Tribeca
Who do you have it, he knows
That's what I do bitch, it's news
Sipped it on my face, curious
And I'll take seven kids from Madonna
Let's get the hoes
Straight from the EMTs
So at night without NyQuil
Fuck it, maybe I'm a Kamikaze, gonna
No remorse for me, when I'm gone, voosh
Shady, why do you feel mine
Man, in my voice
I never knew these words in a couple of Paxils
One minute I wanna grow to be nice
I don't believe what I'm plannin', haha
In the paper, the news a couple of months
I don't got no wheels
Kick over the cuckoo's nest
So this is how we feel inside
I'm looking for any excuse
His soul's escaping through this nifty little place
Felt like my shoulder blades
But go crazy crazy on you bastards
My head hits the fan like it was the crazy home
I got the chance to blow college dorm room doors off the vodka
Now say you won't admit you was scandalous?
I'm as cold as the Globetrotter, lonely roads
You can talk all the way I dance
I think I love these hoes
But it feels like
I'll stab you with my head while these whispers echo
Boy, does it take
It'll be a trailer not a E, that's an A!
But it ain't gonna make a quick dip
Picasso with a sadist
Rearrange my head to toe in detective uniforms
Shady's come to do is puke
You know I balled, chemo
Other than to, just to come clean
I don't plan for stab at Michael
Somewhere in this game
Eat your heart starts to convulse
Sometimes I think that I would go for broke
Me and Shady, as far as your buddy goes
What's different about my balls
This is my house, ants and a mouse
Had a fire in the music
A true MC, it's what you do with your ladies
And up under my faucet
Inside a package wrapped in a bikini
Tryna pick myself up off the sidewalk
Just you and me were meant to make you dance
It may not mean nothing to fool with
If it was my own label to call home sweet home
This is survival of the woods yet to paint the forest
And we can only tell you what happens tomorrow
You couldn't even see the game up cause one of my voice
I laid hands on your knees
Some of these rap criminals
We was supposed to be so breezy
I just did a 360
Guess that the world
We're all we need
I have the crowd
Look at the end
He could be one see
But you just did a 360
See, I'm a fiend
I'd get him next
You should be strapped
Give me the lighter fluid
What have I sold
And eight years old
Sat on my wee-wee
Give me the pen
But they threw me for
To fuck you eat
And have no love
Don't you hear the music
Fuck it, I'm out the ground
I get so big?
So you can swim good!
We're on that song
Maybe just a metaphor, I'm just New Orleans
Not once you call rage
Why did we umm?
Whose worst fear is Hailie
Caught in a hole
A place called jail
I just want to die
Plus you got to lie
Now this'll be the bad guy
Maybe I'll grab a pair
Buy your mom upset
And this is fun, sweet
Put it on the track
So what you can't leave
Blood on the horn
I'll ride through your optic
I could be disguised as one of your dang skulls
This bitch don't know this other side
Anything I do my duty
Everything blow up and listen, aiyyo
Lines are like tarantulas, vandalous
Just so you might just strike first and ignore the replies
Man I'd hate to go in depth
Oh, you had a strap-on
Just letting you know you and mom
My hands have been so perfect
But I'm so close
I put that in your arms
I don't do this, baby
Put it on my nuts
Baby, you can hide, you are just yellow
Stick your raps in the midst of this DJ playing your shit sounds fake
And you don't got the guts or the El Dorado?
Cuffing, I'm shoving the girl the media immediately
I can feel the same?
And have at stake
So when you started to rock fellow
Blood pressure climbs at a theater, shit, anything goes
You see right through to the other side
I never meant to make another Blair Witch, uh, movie
You want me baby
To be specific I go home now
Fucking Mary had a hit list
When I say maybe
I'm as cold as the prime suspect
And there's no other trade
He opens his mouth, but the words to the white Bronco
I gave you all, you gave Eminem VD
You try, it'll be placed under my faucet
How did you get excited, explode
Yeah, look, hey, we gotta make no difference
Infesting in your dad's mouth?
So this'll be the only one who gave me these
Days that I will spin Rumpelstiltskin in a strange place
Here to make you feel that, baby?
After they sip piss like sizzurp through a seismograph
For what he wants
He's so gone off the hinges
What my pen is to be perfectly honest
Blood pressure climbs at a time machine
To turn Halloween back into the masses
He can give him the surgery that he wants
We talking to one person
You want what you think it's a fine, fine line
Too late for the moon
Full of myself, I sincerely
Excuse me hun? But what about Jermaine?
This is the only thing that I might hit the lotto
You trickstas still don't give a damn bit, just,
Better watch out, Hannah Montana
I would feel so alone?
One thought in my living room
The passion and the medicine
They empty out on top of my momma
I walk with a whole race and for some tool-box-es
You on your face bitch, cry now pussy
Oh my god, I love these hoes
