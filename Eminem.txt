Aw, yeah (It's like this, like this)
It's Eminem baby, back up in that motherfucking ass
('Til forever, 'til forever)
One time for your motherfucking mind
(For MCs, MCs)
We represent the 313
You know what I'm saying?
Yo they don't know shit about this
For the '96

Ayo, my pen and paper cause a chain reaction
To get your brain relaxing, the zany-acting maniac in action
A brainiac in fact son, you mainly lack attraction
You look insanely wack when just a fraction of my tracks runs
My rhyming skills got you climbing hills
I travel through your mind and chill your spine like siren drills
I'm sliming grills of roaches, with spray that disinfects
And twisting necks of rappers 'til their spinal column disconnects
Put this in decks and check the monologue, turn your system up
Twist 'em up, and indulge in the marijuana smoke
This is the season for noise pollution contamination
Examination of more car tunes than animation
My lamination of nar-er-ration
Hits a snare and bass in a track for duck rapper interrogation
When I declare invasion, there ain't no time to be staring gazing
I turn the stage into a barren wasteland
I'm infinite

You heard of hell well I was sent from it
I went to it serving a sentence for murderin' instruments
Now I'm trying to repent from it
But when I hear the beat I'm tempted to make another attempt at it
I'm infinite

Bust it, I let the beat commence so I can beat the sense in your elite defense
I got some meat to mince, a crew to stomp and then two feet to rinse
I greet the gents and ladies, I spoil loyal fans
I foil plans and leave fluids leaking like oil pans
My coiled hands around this microphone are lethal
One thought in my cerebral is deeper than a Jeep full of people
MCs are feeble, I came to 'cause some pandemonium
Battle a band of phony MCs and stand the lonely one
Imitator, intimidator, stimulator, simulator of data, eliminator
There's never been a greater since the burial of Jesus
Fuck around and catch all the venereal diseases
My thesis will smash a stereo to pieces
My a cappella releases classic masterpieces through telekinesis
It eases you mentally, gently, sentimentally, instrumentally
With entity, dementedly meant to be infinite

You heard of hell well I was sent from it
I went to it serving a sentence for murderin' instruments
Now I'm trying to repent from it
But when I hear the beat I'm tempted to make another attempt at it
I'm infinite

Man I got evidence I'm never dense and I been clever ever since
My residence was hesitant to do some shit that represents the M-O
So I'm assuming all responsibility
'Cause there's a monster real in me that always wants to kill MCs
Mic nestler, slamming like a wrestler
Here to make a mess of a lyric-smuggling embezzler
No one is specialer, my skill is intergalactical
I get cynical act a fool then I send a crew back to school
I never packed a tool or acted cool, it wasn't practical
I'd rather let a tactical, tactful track tickle your fancy
In fact I can't see, or can't imagine
A man who ain't a lover of beats or a fan of scratching
So this is for my family, the kid who had a cameo on my last jam
Plus the man who never had a plan B
Be all you can be, 'cause once you make an instant hit
I'm tensed a bit and tempted when I see the sins my friends commit
I'm infinite

You heard of hell well I was sent from it
I went to it serving a sentence for murderin' instruments
Now I'm trying to repent from it
But when I hear the beat I'm tempted to make another attempt at it
I'm infinite

'95, '96 ('96)
And on and on and on (and on and on)

Check it out
Hey Kyu!

It's a broke day but everything is OK (It's OK)
I'm up all night, but everything is alright (It's alright)
It's a rough week, and I don't get enough sleep (I can't sleep)
It's a long year pretending I belong here (Belong here)
It's a broke day but everything is OK (It's OK)
I'm up all night, but everything is alright (It's alright)
It's a rough week, and I don't get enough sleep (I can't sleep)
It's a long year pretending I belong here (Belong here)

One day I plan to be a family man happily married
I wanna grow to be so old that I have to be carried
'Til I'm glad to be buried
And leave this crazy world
And have at least a half a million for my baby girl
It may be early to be planning this stuff
'Cause I'm still struggling hard to be the man, and it's tough
'Cause man it's been rough, but still I manage enough
I've been taken advantage of, damaged and scuffed
My hands have been cuffed
But I don't panic and huff, frantic and puff
Or plan to give up, the minute shit hits the fan it erupts
I'm anteing up double or nothing, I've been troubled enough
And I'm sick of struggling and suffering, see
My destiny's to rest at ease, 'til I'm impressed and pleased
With my progress, I won't settle for less than cheese
I'm on a quest to seize all, my own label to call
Way before my baby is able to crawl
I'm too stable to fall, the pressure motivates
To know I hold the weight of boulders on my shoulder blades
I seen the golden gates to heaven on Earth
Where they don't pull a weapon on you when you're stepping on turf, Kyu

It's a broke day but everything is OK (It's OK)
I'm up all night, but everything is alright (It's alright)
It's a rough week, and I don't get enough sleep (I can't sleep)
It's a long year pretending I belong here (Belong here)
It's a broke day but everything is OK (It's OK)
I'm up all night, but everything is alright (It's alright)
It's a rough week, and I don't get enough sleep (I can't sleep)
It's a long year pretending I belong here (Belong here)

I'm going for broke, gambling and playing for keeps
Every day in the streets, scrambling and paying for cheap
Praying for sleep
Dreaming with a watering mouth
Wishing for a better life for my daughter and spouse
In this slaughtering house, caught up in bouts
With the root of all evil
I've seen it turn beautiful people crude and deceitful
And make them do shit illegal
For these Grants and Jacksons
These transactions explain a man's actions
But in the midst of this insanity, I found my Christianity
Through God and there's a wish he granted me
He showed me how to cope with the stress
And hope for the best, instead of mope and depressed
Always groping a mess, of flying over the nest
To selling dope with the rest
I quit smoking cess to open my chest
Life is stressful inside this cesspool
Trying to wrestle, I almost bust a blood vessel
My little brother's trying to learn his mathematics
He's asthmatic, running home from school away from crack addicts
Kids attract static, children with automatics
Taking target practice on teens for Starter Jackets
I'm using smarter tactics to overcome this slum
I won't become as dumb as some and succumb to scum
It's cumbersome, I'm trying to do well on this Earth
But it's been Hell on this Earth since I fell on this Earth

It's a broke day but everything is OK (It's OK)
I'm up all night, but everything is alright (It's alright)
It's a rough week, and I don't get enough sleep (I can't sleep)
It's a long year pretending I belong here (Belong here)
It's a broke day but everything is OK (It's OK)
I'm up all night, but everything is alright (It's alright)
It's a rough week, and I don't get enough sleep (I can't sleep)
It's a long year pretending I belong here (Belong here)

Uh, it's OK, yeah it's alright, even though I can't sleep
Uh yeah, it's OK, it's alright, I can't sleep

Now what you know about a sweet MC, from the 313
None of these skills you 'bout to see come free
So you wanna be a sweet MC, you gotta become me
If you ever wanna be one see

Man what you know about a sweet MC in the 313
None of these skills you 'bout to see come free
So you wanna be a sweet MC, you better become me
If you ever wanna be one see


I got more different strokes than Philip Drummound
On open mic I bone your woman just to keep my lyrics coming (bitch)
We elevated to new heights premeditated
Let it be that I stated they hate it now that they see that I made it
The escalated can be put to the test of greatness
Snatch the heart from MCs and I ate it
So I take it that's the reason I'm hated
To represent my temperament
If rap was a dick all you so called hard MCs would not be impotent
But pimping it, and acting like you could rock a show (so)
Harder than LL's Rock the Bells, and you's a ho (now)
Everything that you collaborate I lacerate
My rhymes they keep coming like nymphomaniacs that masturbate
At a faster rate, yeah I got something for your ass to hate
I blast your hate, and have you all running past the gates
And as for face clutching and touching the flows
I got them open like marijuana smoke up in your nose
Bucking these hoes, I got that shit down to a science
Leaving them hot and bothered, turned on like an appliance
Defiance? No we won't have that
You want your shit to blow up?
Well I'ma stuff some dynamite in your ass crack
And blast that shit to kingdom come
Then bring them some of this real hip-hop
I drop beats and you ain't singing or gonna do a thing but run
And you all knew from Meeko
That you couldn't hold your own with the strength of Lou Ferrigno
So stop that bullshit flow
Yo, you need to come with the real skills, and act like you know

So what you know about a sweet MC in the 313
None of these skills you 'bout to see come free
So you wanna be a sweet MC, you better become me
If you ever wanna be one see

Now what you know about a sweet MC from the 313
None of these skills you 'bout to see come free
So you wanna be a sweet MC, you gotta become me
If you ever wanna be one see

So what you know about a sweet MC, in the 313
You don't know shit so when you see one flee
You can be Run-D, you'll never be the MC
I stopped the alphabet at S and got it down to a T
I'm sure you're bound to agree, a sweet MC crash the spot
I'll make the roof hot like I was Rock Master Scott
Your ass forgot, so just in case you don't remember me
I'll run your brain around the block to jog your fucking memory
It's either them or me man, kill or be killed
Your will'll be sealed your casket closed you still'll be billed
My facilities filled with fans, packed to capacity
I'll send a rapper back with the crack of his ass shitty
If he's acting soft and he cowers
He better come cleaner than Jeru jacking off when he showers
You flowers got no clout with a thing
You could date a stick of dynamite and wouldn't go out with a bang
I shout with a slang, simple as ABCs
Skip over the Ds and rock the microphone with ease
Dethrone MCs and I'ma max alone
Relax your dome like a solo from a saxophone
So facts are known, biters get treated with shots
I rock a beat harder than you could beat it with rocks
I'm greeted with flocks of fellow follower singers
You couldn't make the fans throw up their hands if they swallowed their fingers
But you can bring yours let's see what you got
But don't front and never try to be what you're not
'Cause you can be quick, jump the candlestick, burn your back
And fuck Jill on a hill, but you still ain't Jack

So what you know about a sweet MC, from the 313
None of these skills you just seen come free
So you wanna be a sweet MC, you gotta become me
So you ain't ever gonna be one see

So what you know about a sweet MC in the 313
None of these skills that you just seen come free

So you ain't ever gonna be one see

Tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight

I'm getting mad love, I'm snuggling hugs
Strugglin' thugs, smuggling drugs, juggling jobs, guzzling jugs
So here's a toast to federal checks
Hetero sex, unaffordable medical debts, huh
We travel in packs and ravel in facts and gravel in cracks
To find babbling Max, gaffling tracks
I grapple an axe for them baffling acts
Of mysterious stab-in-the-backs who dabble in wax
Stealin' my art when I sculpt it
The culprit that stole shit'll end up with his skull split
Then I buried the hatchet, I carry the fat shit
Butterfingers is here when it's necessary to scratch it
Baby, all I wanna do is swallow one or two
Smoke a little bit and follow one of you
Back home when the party ends
So tonight I'm dropping naughty hints
To the finest women in the audience

Tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight

Cause we came here to do this tonight
We don't wanna fight, we don't want no one feeling uptight
Cause we came here to do this tonight
Till the morning light hope that everyone's feeling alright
Cause we came here to do this tonight
We don't wanna fight, we don't want no one feeling uptight
Cause we came here to do this tonight
Till the morning light hope that everyone's feeling alright

Ayo, biters are like tarantulas, vandalous
Living as scandalous as a television evangelist
But I can handle this, I'm the rhyme biter crime fighter
Caped crusader, taking care of undeserving lime lighters
I think we live in era meant for me
Experimentally I found a way to spread the terror mentally
When I stumbled upon this resolution
By using a special fusion of chemical solution for this fresh illusion
You couldn't see me with binoculars
I'm armed like an octopus
Step on stage and you get socked and pushed
Talking that junk like you had Black Bart at your back
Come to battle me and you get smacked hard as you act
When I rep-a-resent it, and will have a referee in it
Every minute so when I win it you never resent it
I'm forever demented, come up with funk, I'll never be scented
You got the point when I cleverly sent it

Tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight

Cause we came here to do this tonight
We don't wanna fight, we don't want no one feeling uptight
Cause we came here to do this tonight
Till the morning light hope that everyone's feeling alright
Cause we came here to do this tonight
We don't wanna fight, we don't want no one feeling uptight
Cause we came here to do this tonight
Till the morning light hope that everyone's feeling alright

Eminem is heading skyward
For those who thought that I would make you bored and treat you like a piece of plywood
I've got miracle lyrical capability all in me
With the agility to escape a killer bee colony
So get your cameras and capture how miraculous
I rap for all you Draculas and showed you all how whack you was
I meant it as a diss, 'cause you don't posses the pizazz of this
I'm hazardous enough already as it is
Without you adding fuel to the fire
I'm cruel to the liar
Who fails to recognize my reign and hail rule to the sire
Clinical studies show that I'm cynical
There's no one who's identical to my fresh and authentic flow
I'm sure the party people can agree
That I'm enchanting, rhythm romantically
Freaking vocals so frantically
So throw your hands up in the atmosphere
And let them know the only party that was phat was here, just be like

Tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight

Cause we came here to do this tonight
We don't wanna fight, we don't want no one feeling uptight
Cause we came here to do this tonight
Till the morning light hope that everyone's feeling alright
Cause we came here to do this tonight
We don't wanna fight, we don't want no one feeling uptight
Cause we came here to do this tonight
Till the morning light hope that everyone's feeling alright

Maxine!
Hello
Can I speak to Maxine?
Yeah, this is me, what's up?
What up?
Who dis?
Denaun
Yeah, what's up?
What are you doing?
Nothing, just laying in bed
Huh?
Nothing, just laying in bed
Why?
I don't know, thinking about something freaky to do

I know this crack fiend, Maxine, who needs a vaccine
She tests positive, but tells you that her act's clean
Plus she got a sugar daddy
Gassin' every hooker that he takes in to crook her badly
If you mistook her, sadly, on her reputation
You're in jeopardation, if you ain't got no preparation
When you stepped away, son, she got her face done
Lookin' provocative, she'll let you knock it if
You press the issue, and get undressed to kiss you
If you match the price, otherwise she won't look at you twice
But when you catch the lice, or get the urgency
To go to the emergency 'cause it burns to pee
Don't bring your germs to me, 'cause I ain't tryna hear it
While you're fightin' your fuckin' disease, tryna clear it


Denaun, what up, man?
What up, dawg?
You all right?
Chillin', cold as hell
Yes, it is. Hey, bus didn't come here, didn't he?
No. Hey look, you got 15 cent?
Nah, I got just enough to get on the bus, I'm broke
We gotta go to the store. Alright, man?
Quick, 'cause I'm short
Yeah, we gonna have enough time to go to the store?
Nah, look
You should just, how much you got there?
I only got 75, I'm sure I got a dollar, know what I mean?
Just throw it in there, they ain't gonna know. You know what? Ayy look, I'm sick of takin' this damn bus everywhere, man
You gotta make some moves or somethin'
I know, look, I'm tryna get rich
I got a baby on the way, I don't even got a car. You know what I'm sayin'?
I still stay with my moms, 21 and still with my moms
Yeah, look, hey, we gotta make some hit records or somethin', you know what I'm sayin'?
'Cause I'm tired of bein' broke

'Cause all I do is yearn a life without a concern
And dream of havin' a turn to earn money to burn
Mappin' out my strategies to get rich, huh
My desire's like a scratch that needs to get itched, huh
'Cause, man, I live in the D, this shit ain't given for free
Nothin' is different to me, so what else is there to see?
I'll be the prisoner to flee from all of this misery
I'm not wishin' to be another fish in the sea
But just an MC, so listen to me for this and agree
You're missin' the key, you ain't even in the vicinity
Unconditionally, my aspects to cash checks
My objects were never to swab decks
It's up to you, the decision is yours
If what you vision is tours, or a missionless course
When your shit is in the stores, 'cause you can be a star

No matter wherever you are
You're never too far from revenue par
'Cause you can be king
You can rule the world, you can do anything
It's on you, baby, 'cause you can be a star
No matter wherever you are
You're never too far from revenue par
'Cause you can be king
You can rule the world, you can do anything
It's on you, baby, 'cause you can be a star
No matter wherever you are
You're never too far from revenue, huh

You know what I'm sayin'? See what I'm talkin' about, man? 'Cause that's it. Yeah.
A million dollars ain't even that far away, man.
Yo, we got to get the money, man!
I can't be broke for the rest of my life!
Yeah, I hear what your sayin'. Look, there's got to be somethin' better, you know what I'm sayin'?
I can't live like this for the rest of my life, man.
Bummin' rides everywhere I go.
Yeah, what's up with Lexus's and Land Cruisers?

Yo, I'm not about to chance it and dismiss handlin' business
I'm cancelin' Christmas to gamble and risk this
Financial interest is the matter at hand
I got an adequate plan for stab at a grand
I grab what I can and do what I must
Pursue what I lust, it's true that I just
Choose the few that I trust
Them's the people that I still got
Fuck with gangsta Philpot, get your grill shot
The 5 Ela for life: my man Thyme
Proof, Kyu and Denaun, we move through in the nine
My crew's true and divine, we never fronted
We just wanted to be funded, and live to be a hundred
Instead of hunted or bein' wanted as fugitives
It's all about a man plannin' what his future is
What he can do for his to be a star

No matter wherever you are
You're never too far from revenue par
'Cause you can be king
You can rule the world, you can do anything
It's on you, baby, 'cause you can be a star
No matter wherever you are
You're never too far from revenue par
'Cause you can be king
You can rule the world, you can do anything
It's on you, baby, 'cause you can be a star
No matter wherever you are
You're never too far from revenue, huh

That's what I'm talkin' about.
I'm not tryna be the player, I'm tryna be the mayor.
I want to be president.
Yo, forgot that president, man.
I'm tryna be king, makin' dead presidents.
You know what I'm sayin'?
Gettin' money any time I want, ownin' my own businesses and all that. You know what I'm sayin'?
Yeah, I'm tryna be a millionaire, man.
Hahaha, but don't all, you know?
You only live once, '96, baby

I'm reminiscin' on your tenderness
And the snugglin' and teasin'
Missin' what I remember
Kissin' and huggin' and squeezin'
Buggin' and wheezin'
I'm havin' trouble when breathin'
It's even tougher when sleepin'
But there's a couple of reasons that I'm sufferin' and grievin'
For lovin' and leavin'
You're all I'm thinkin' of in the evenin'
You got my knees bucklin' and weakenin'
Thoughts of nothin' but freakin'
That I'm strugglin' to keep in
And interrupt when I'm speakin'
I got some game that I'm preparin' to run
The way your lips sparkle and they glare in the sun
You got your hair in a bun
No matter what you're wearin' you stun
'Cause you're comparin' to none
I want to share in the fun, I feel a passionate lust
When I imagine it just alone at last when it's us
I see you graspin' to trust
But my intentions are good, let's leave the past in the dust
I'm not askin' to rush
And answer me immediately
I just wanna be there for you and you to be there for me
If you agree to repeat after me
"I love you" (I love you, baby)
'Cause I just need you to see
How much I'm eager to be your man legally wed
Your love's keepin' me fed
This is easily said, so you can lead or be led
If you care to be down
'Cause ain't nobody like you nowhere to be found

Attention all units, attention all units
We have an all-points bulletin out on a man with green hair
I repeat, we have an APB on a man with green hair
He's armed with a knife, I repeat, he's armed with a knife
Proceed with caution, watch your back, fellas
He could be coming at your girlfriend next

There's a joker on the loose from the psychiatric ward
His face is up on the bulletin board with a reward
He'll stab you with a sword, don't be fooled by his charm
He's probably armed with intent to do bodily harm
Ring the alarm, look for a man with green hair
Check at your girl's house, he was last seen there
He's has a mean stare but usually cracks jokes
Good luck on your mission and guard your backs, folks

Come here, you fuckin' backstabber!
(Why I oughta) beat a bitch snake from the hood
Ha ha, come here, you fuckin' backstabber!
(Why I oughta) stay away from him, he ain't no good!

We got the walkie-talkies to keep us all informed
Suited up head to toe in detective uniforms
Our unit storms in, we split the ghetto in sectors
Lockin' down every block and put up metal detectors
Protect yours and be sure that you stand close
Watch each other's backs and guard your command post
And most of all be advised that he's wise
He could be disguised as one of your very own guys

Come here, you fuckin' backstabber!
(Why I oughta) beat a bitch snake from the hood
Ha ha, come here, you fuckin' backstabber!
(Why I oughta) stay away from him, he ain't no good!

I'm on a solo mission to find him personally
To settle the score and to beat him unmercifully
For what he first did to me, it's sure to be the last
Followin' footprints with a magnifyin' glass
To drag his lyin' ass back to his padded cell
I'm mad as hell, on the trail of this tattle tail
I heard a yell, the voice sounded familiar
"Give me your girlfriend or I'm gonna kill ya!"

Come here, you fuckin' backstabber!
(Why I oughta) beat a bitch snake from the hood
Ha ha, come here, you fuckin' backstabber!
(Why I oughta) stay away from him, he ain't no good!

I followed the voice that led down a flight of steps
Sneezin' at dust, and swingin' at the spider webs
Inside the depths of his basement
I taste lint, in my mouth
Then the lights in the place went
I saw my life flash in front of my eyes
I felt a butcher knife slash at one of my thighs
None of my guys knew where I'm at, I was doomed
Then I remembered the flashlight in my costume

Come here, you fuckin' backstabber!
(Why I oughta) beat a bitch snake from the hood
Ha ha, come here, you fuckin' backstabber!
(Why I oughta) stay away from him, he ain't no good!

Dealing with backstabbers, there was one thing I learned
They're only powerful when you got your back turned
I yearned for the day that we finally met again
So I can give him a taste of his own medicine
He shed his skin, then he promised to come clean
I took his butcher knife and jabbed it into his spleen
Cuffed him at the scene, then dragged the fella home
Beating him over the head with the telephone

Attention all cars, attention all cars
Unit 313 has apprehended the suspect
He's going back to the crazy home
I repeat, he's going back to the crazy home
Job well done

Come here, you fuckin' backstabber!
(Why I oughta) beat a bitch snake from the hood
Ha ha, come here, you fuckin' backstabber!
(Why I oughta) stay away from him, he ain't no good!

Come here, you fuckin' backstabber!
(Why I oughta) beat a bitch snake from the hood
Ha ha, come here, you fuckin' backstabber!
(Why I oughta) stay away from him, he ain't no good!

Come here, you fuckin' backstabber!
(Why I oughta) beat a bitch snake from the hood
Ha ha, come here, you fuckin' backstabber!
(Why I oughta) stay away from him, he ain't no good!

Jealous!
Jealous!
Jealous!
Jealous!
Jealous!
Jealous!
Jealous!
Jealous!

Jealous?! What he mean "jealous"?
Know what I'm sayin'? He just mad 'cause he all with them ugly hoes, know what I'm sayin'?
Girls don't buy him no clothes
He bought that ho some clothes!
He don't buy me no clothes
That nigga ain't got no money, no vibe, no dick
I mean, what do I got to be jealous for?
He ain't gonna make it nowhere
He ain't got no type of time
He has no career move, I mean…

I come home every single day from workin' double shifts
And stop along the way to pick you up a couple gifts
I come inside and you pretend you miss me
When you kiss me, then you diss me
And we strenuously fight continuously
Again you frisk me, for numbers, tryin' to bust me
It must be only just because you never learned to trust me
Plus we only squabble over irrelevant issues
Too many tissues for my feelings you misuse
I buy you jewelry, you make a fool of me
I bring you diamond rings, you say I'm bad at timin' things
So what's a man to do
When all I hand to you is handed back to me?
You act to be this gangsta bitch
That ain't what first attracted me
I used to love your company
Now you're always pumpin' me for information
And you tell your friends you plan on dumpin' me
So I'ma wait for your evacuation
'Cause every accusation
Makes me wanna smack your face in
See, I've never been so sure, and you're just insecure
So my solution to your jealousy presents a cure
I recommend you take your things and check 'em in
Look at the nervous wreck I'm in
I need my second wind—say what?!

Jealo!
Jealousy!
Jealousy!

Fuck you and what you going through! Fuck Eminem!
He just mad 'cause I left that nigga for another man
Me and Eminem don't need nothin' but minus money
Immature, me? Nigga ain't got no dick
No swang in his thang, know what I'm sayin'?
He just mad 'cause I'm gettin' it all night
Jealous of me, know what I'm sayin'?
That's what I'm talkin' about
Motherfucker just tryin' to get this pussy

I used to be a puppet and a sucker for your silent treatments
I used to be intoxicated with your sweet scents
Until the day I started followin' your feet prints
And tappin' in your phone conversations
Through the heat vents—it made complete sense
There's someone else you like
So I confronted you and asked you, "Who was Mike?"
And you was like, (I need a new nigga)
"Someone rich that I could follow
And you'll be over me by the time you see tomorrow."
Leavin' me in sorrow, Brandy never felt so broken-hearted
I fell apart when you departed, then the jokin' started
I was an open target, you play comedian
And I became the laughing stock
But now I'm on my feet again
And so we meet again, you're actin' like an ex-wife
All in my sex life, I got a message from Phife
It goes, "You didn't want me to see yo' hon
Don't want me now, take the towel, wipe your brow!"
Quit tryin' to hunt me down!
You run me down and now your tryin' to apologize
For all the lies and every time you made me ball my eyes
Because I got a bigger wallet size, you wanna swing it
Jealousy is in the house, y'all—fellas, sing it!

Jealo!
Jealousy!
Jealousy!

"I'm low down and dirty, but not ashamed"
"Low down dirty even" I'm low down and I'm shifty!
And if you hear a man that sounds like me smack him
And ask him where the fuck did he get his damn raps from
"I'm low down and dirty, but not ashamed"
"Low down dirty even" I'm low down and I'm shifty!
And if you hear a man that sounds like me smack him
And ask him where the fuck did he get his damn raps from

Warning, this shit's gon' be rated R, restricted
You see this bullet hole in my neck? It's self-inflicted
Doctor slapped my momma, "Bitch, you got a sick kid"
Arrested, molested myself and got convicted
Wearing visors, sunglasses and disguises
'Cause my split personality is having an identity crisis
I'm Dr. Hyde and Mr. Jekyll, disrespectful
Hearing voices in my head while these whispers echo
(Murder-murder, redrum)
Brain size of a bread crumb
Which drug will I end up dead from?
Inebriated 'til my stress is alleviated
"How in the fuck can Eminem and Shady be related?"
Illiterate, illegitimate shit spitter
Bitch getter, hid in the bush like Margot Kidder
Jumped out (RRRAH!), killed the bitch and did her
Used to let the babysitter suck my dick when I was littler
Smoke a blunt while I'm titty fucking Bette Midler
Sniper, waiting on your roof like the Fiddler
Y'all thought I was gonna rhyme with Riddler, didn't ya?
Bring your bitch, I wanna see if this dick gon' fit in her

"I'm low down and dirty, but not ashamed"
"Low down dirty even" I'm low down and I'm shifty!
And if you hear a man that sounds like me smack him
And ask him where the fuck did he get his damn raps from
"I'm low down and dirty, but not ashamed"
"Low down dirty even" I'm low down and I'm shifty!
And if you hear a man that sounds like me smack him
And ask him where the fuck did he get his damn raps from

I lace tunes, that's out this world like space moons
With a bunch crazed loons dismissin' brains like graze wounds
Nothing but idiots and misfits, dipshits
Doing whippets, passed out like sampler snippets
Where's the weed, I wanna tamper with it
I'ma let your grandpa hit it
Lace it up with cocaine so he can't forget it
Fuck it, maybe I'm a bum
But I was put on this earth to make your baby mama cum
So what I'm on is way beyond the rum
Or any alcoholic beverage, losing all of my leverage
Went up inside the First National Bank broke, and left rich
Walking bio-hazard causing wreckage, smoked out like Eckrich
Dandruff's making my neck itch, what the fuck? Give me the check bitch
You just lost your tip, there's a pubic hair in my breakfast
Got shit popping off like bottle cap tips
Get your cap peeled like the dead skin of your mama's chapped lips
Slap dips, support domestic violence
Beat your bitch's ass while your kids stare in silence
I'm just joking, is Dirty Dozen really dust smoking?
If all your shit's missing, then probably one of us broke in

"I'm low down and dirty, but not ashamed"
"Low down dirty even" I'm low down and I'm shifty!
And if you hear a man that sounds like me smack him
And ask him where the fuck did he get his damn raps from
"I'm low down and dirty, but not ashamed"
"Low down dirty even" I'm low down and I'm shifty!
And if you hear a man that sounds like me smack him
And ask him where the fuck did he get his damn raps from

My head's ringing, like it was Spider Sense tingling
Blitzin' like Green Bay did when they shitted on New England
I'm out the game, put the second string in
This Brandy got me swinging, bobbing back and forth like a penguin (Allah, Allah)
Delinquent, choking microphones with broken English
Make your mama be like "Whoo, this is good! Who sings this?"
"Slim Shady, his tape is dope, I dug it
It's rugged, but he needs to quit talking all that drug shit"
It was predicted by a medic, I'd grow
To be an addicted diabetic, living on liquid Triaminic
Pathetic, but I don't think this headache's ever vanishing
Panicking, I think I might have just took too much Anacin
Frozen mannequin, posin' stiffer than a statue
I think I'm dying, God is that you?
Somebody help me, before I OD on an LP
Take me to ER ASAP for an IV
Motherfuck JLB, they don't support no hip hop
They say that's where it lives
The closest they gon' come is 2Pac
It's politics, it's all a fix
Set up for these white blue-collared hicks
It's to make a dollar off of black music
With a subliminal ball of tricks
For those who kiss ass and swallow dicks

"I'm low down and dirty, but not ashamed"
"Low down dirty even" I'm low down and I'm shifty!
And if you hear a man that sounds like me smack him
And ask him where the fuck did he get his damn raps from
"I'm low down and dirty, but not ashamed"
"Low down dirty even" I'm low down and I'm shifty!
And if you hear a man that sounds like me smack him
And ask him where the fuck did he get his damn raps from

What is life?
Life is like a big obstacle
In front of your optical to slow you down
And every time you think you've gotten past it
It's gonna come back around to tackle you to the damn ground

What are friends?
Friends are people that you think are your friends
But they're really your enemies, with secret identities
And disguises to hide their true colors
So just when you think you're close enough to be brothers
They wanna come back and cut your throat when you ain't lookin'

What is money?
Money is what makes a man act funny
Money is the root of all evil
Money'll make them same friends come back around
Swearing that they was always down

What is life?
I'm tired of life

I'm tired of backstabbing ass snakes with friendly grins
I'm tired of committing so many sins
Tired of always giving in when this bottle of Henny wins
Tired of never having any ends
Tired of having skinny friends hooked on crack and mini-thins
I'm tired of this DJ playing your shit when he spins
Tired of not having a deal
Tired of having to deal with the bullshit without grabbing the steel
Tired of drowning in my sorrow
Tired of having to borrow a dollar for gas to start my Monte Carlo
I'm tired of motherfuckers sprayin' shit and dartin' off
I'm tired of jobs startin' off at five fifty an hour
Then this boss wonders why I'm smartin' off
I'm tired of being fired every time I fart and cough
Tired of having to work as a gas station clerk
For this jerk breathing down my neck driving me berserk
I'm tired of using plastic silverware
Tired of workin' at Builder's Square
Tired of not being a millionaire

But if I had a million dollars
I'd buy a damn brewery, and turn the planet into alcoholics
If I had a magic wand, I'd make the world suck my dick
Without a condom on, while I'm on the john
If I had a million bucks
It wouldn't be enough, because I'd still be out
Robbing armored trucks
If I had one wish
I would ask for a big enough ass for the whole world to kiss

I'm tired of being white trash, broke and always poor
Tired of taking pop bottles back to the party store
I'm tired of not having a phone
Tired of not having a home to have one in if I did have one on
Tired of not driving a BM
Tired of not working at GM, tired of wanting to be him
Tired of not sleeping without a Tylenol PM
Tired of not performing in a packed coliseum
Tired of not being on tour
Tired of fucking the same blonde whore
After work in the back of a Contour
I'm tired of faking knots with a stack of ones
Having a lack of funds and resorting back to guns
Tired of being stared at
Tired of wearing the same damn Nike Air hat
Tired of stepping in clubs wearing the same pair of Lugz
Tired of people saying they're tired of hearing me rap about drugs
Tired of other rappers who ain't bringin' half the skill as me
Saying they wasn't feeling me on "Nobody's As Ill As Me"
And I'm tired of radio stations telling fibs
Tired of JLB saying "Where Hip-Hop Lives"

But if I had a million dollars
I'd buy a damn brewery, and turn the planet into alcoholics
If I had a magic wand, I'd make the world suck my dick
Without a condom on, while I'm on the john
If I had a million bucks
It wouldn't be enough, because I'd still be out
Robbing armored trucks
If I had one wish
I would ask for a big enough ass for the whole world to kiss

You know what I'm saying?
I'm tired of all of this bullshit
Telling me to be positive
How'm I 'posed to be positive when I don't see shit positive?
You know what I'm sayin'?
I rap about shit around me, shit I see
Know what I'm sayin'? Right now I'm tired of everything
Tired of all this player-hating that's going on in my own city
Can't get no airplay, you know what I'm sayin'?
But hey, it's cool though, you know what I'm sayin'?
Just fed up
That's my word

Whoa, a-get your hands in the air
And get to clappin' 'em and, like, back and forth
Because a-this is what you thought it wasn't
It be's the brothers representin' the Dirty Dozen
I be the F-R-O, the double G
And check out my man, he goes by the name of, um, er

Slim Shady, brain dead like Jim Brady
I'm a M-80, you little like that Kim lady
I'm buzzin', Dirty Dozen, naughty rotten rhymer
Cursin' at you players worse than Marty Schottenheimer
You wacker than the motherfucker you bit your style from
You ain't gon' sell two copies if you press a double album
Admit it, fuck it, while we comin' out in the open
I'm doin' acid, crack, smack, coke, and smokin' dope then
My name is Marshall Mathers, I'm an alcoholic (Hi, Marshall)
I have a disease and they don't know what to call it
Better hide your wallet 'cause I'm comin' up quick to strip your cash
Bought a ticket to your concert just to come and whip your ass
Bitch, I'm comin' out swingin' so fast it'll make your eyes spin
You gettin' knocked the fuck out like Mike Tyson (Pssh)
The proof is in the puddin', just ask DeShaun Holton
I'll slit your motherfuckin' throat worse than Ron Goldman

So when you see me on your block with two Glocks
Screamin', "Fuck the world" like 2Pac (I just don't give a fuck)
Talkin' that shit behind my back, dirty mackin'
Tellin' your boys that I'm on crack (I just don't give a fuck)
So put my tape back on the rack, go run and tell your friends
My shit is wack (I just don't give a fuck)
But see me on the street and duck
'Cause you gon' get stuck, stoned, and snuffed
('Cause I just don't give a fuck)

I'm nicer than Pete, but I'm on a search to crush a milkbone
I'm everlastin', I melt vanilla ice like silicone
I'm ill enough to just straight up diss you for no reason
I'm colder than snow season when it's 20 below freezin'
Flavor with no seasoning, this is the sneak preview
I'll diss your magazine and still won't get a weak review
I'll make your freak leave you, smell the Folgers crystals
This is lyrical combat, gentlemen, hold your pistols
But I form like Voltron and blast you with my shoulder missiles
Slim Shady, M&M was the old initials (Bye-bye)
Extortion, snortin', supportin' abortion
Pathological liar, blowin' shit outta proportion
The looniest, zaniest, spontaneous, sporadic
Impulsive thinker, compulsive drinker, addict
Half animal, half man
Dumpin' your dead body inside of a fuckin' trash can
With more holes than an afghan

So when you see me on your block with two Glocks

'Cause you finna get stuck, stoned, and snuffed
('Cause I just don't give a fuck)

Somebody let me out this limousine (Hey, let me out)
I'm a caged demon
On stage screamin' like Rage Against the Machine
I'm convinced I'm a fiend
Shootin' up while this record is spinnin'
Clinically brain-dead, I don't need a second opinion
Fuck droppin' a jewel, I'm flippin' a sacred treasure
I'll bite your motherfuckin' style just to make it fresher
I can't take the pressure, I'm sick of bitches
Sick of naggin' bosses bitchin' while I'm washin' dishes
In school, I never said much, too busy havin' a head rush
Doin' too much rush, had my face flushed like red blush
Then I went to Jim Beam, that's when my face grayed
Went to gym in eighth grade, raped the women's swim team
Don't take me for a joke, I'm no comedian
Too many mental problems got me snortin' coke and smokin' weed again
I'm goin' up over the curb, drivin' on the median
Finally made it home but I don't got the key to get in

(Shit, fuck everybody)
Outsiderz, Pacewon, Young Zee (Fuck the entire world)
D.U.

Yeah… ha ha ha (Bang!)
Yeah, Bizarre Kid comin' at you
Eminem and Fuzz and Mr. Swifty, ha ha
No one's iller than me (What?)
No one, no one is iller than me
No one is iller than me
It's Mr. Swifty from the 313

I make rappers wanna turn into singers
I keep hoes lickin' they fingers
Bring this competition and face this meaning
Got your whole crew doin' subpoenas
Hell nah, you ain't seen a crew, genius
Murder whoever's between us, pack your heaters
Keep it close, you can't beat us
While your whole crew treat us like Gs, you best believe this
I done made quadriplegics outta these non-rappin' rejects
While the whole world ejects your tape
It ain't no secret that your shit sounds fake
You can't stop it, my mind state
Makes it too late for cops in tryin' to stop the crime rate
I'm like toothaches: I'm painful to rappers
Then you can tell from these shells
How I gotta bend 'em like root canals
I erase all trails, somethin' farther from gettin' bail
Makes you wanna kill an emcee yourself, you might as well
Be within a 25 to life sentence, on linking trials
Horrified, and keep on frontin', repentin' and lose they bowels
Everything is foul when Swift's around, vacate now
Niggas dumb enough to try to front and escape, how?
I'm gonna take this 'gnac and drink it straight wild
Niggas steady fallin' in my face like milk crates – BLAAAOW!
It's Swifty from the 313
Like I said, no one is iller than me, unnhh

Me and Eminem and Mike, drivin' down Van Dyke
Get my dick sucked late at night by a fuckin' transvestite
Still on probation for stranglin' my boy Jason
Should be takin' my medication, it's nine to ten I'm facin'
Last week this old man I had to blast
'Cause he tried to help me out when my car was out of gas
Ripped this old lady, hung her neck by a hook
Didn't realize it was my grandmother 'til I checked her pocketbook
Fuckin' with the white boys got me back on crack
Better explain where the hell your TVs and VCRs is at
I done lost 100 pounds, I ain't been eatin' like I should
This wounded dog in the street is sure lookin' good
Rob this little boy in his fuckin' paper route
Throwin' bombs at day care centers and yell, "Everybody get out!"
My girl beat my ass and shot me in the back with a two-piece
'Cause she found out I was havin' an affair
With her 10-year-old niece

No one, no one's iller than me
It's Bizarre Kid straight from the 313
No one, no one is iller than me
It's Bizarre Kid straight from the 313

Nobody better test me, 'cause I don't wanna get messy
Especially when I step inside this bitch, dipped freshly
New Lugz, give the crew hugs, guzzle two mugs
Before I do drugs that make me throw up like flu bugs
True thugs, rugged unshaven messy scrubs
Whippin' 40-bottles like the fuckin' Pepsi clubs
Down a fifth, crack open a six
I'm on my seventh 8-Ball, now I gotta take a piss
I'm hollerin' at these hoes that got boyfriends
Who gives a fuck who they was?
I'm always takin' someone else's girl like Cool J does
They probably don't be packin' anyways — do they, Fuzz?
We walked up, stomped they asses and blew they buzz
Mics get sandblasted, stab your abdomen
With a hand-crafted pocketknife and spill your antacid
Sprayed your motherfuckin' crib up when I ran past it
Fuckin' felon, headed to Hell in a hand basket
Talkin' shit'll get you, your girl and your man blasted
Kidnapped and slapped in a van, wrapped in Saran plastic
Get your damn ass kicked
By these fantastic furious four motherfuckers
Flashin' in front of your face without the Grandmasters
Slim Shady, ain't nobody iller than me

I run shit like an ass with legs
Massive lead to leave your cabbage red
Similar to your ass in a casket dead
Drastic spread of acid heads
Come to abort you like a bastard egg
That trash you said got you standin' on plastic legs
Ask the feds if I'm past the edge
Rockin' the most classic threads, flashin' bread
Roll down the window, "Bitch, you got some fantastic legs!"
You can get 'til that ass get red
You can get 'til that ass get red
Bizarre, you get him and him
Swift, you get him and him, I'll get him and him
Leave the other two for my nigga Eminem
Never writer's block, I block writers
My block's tighter, ante up and get your top fighters
Got fired for jumpin' the counter with a mop stick
Some bitch ran up screamin', "Get the cops, quick!"
And got drop kicked, now she screamin', "Stop it!"
Got clips to stop shit, rock shit and grab this hot shit
Wherever you shop, bitch, Fuzz Scoota '97 crop pick
Sick of y'all niggas lookin' at me like I got tits
I shoot a rocket through your optic
You niggas still don't know the top pick
I got bricks, lose my foot in your ass
And have you shittin' socks, bitch
P Rock shit, leave your fuckin' knot split
Grab the green from Al by showin' him hot grits
(No one) — Ain't nobody iller than me

It's the Mr. Fuzzy from the 313
No one, no one is iller than me
It's Eminem and Swift from the 313
No one, no one is iller than me
It's Fuzz and Buzz-arre from the 313

You have now witnessed four ill emcees
From the home of potholes and trash
We'll lyrically blast

"All I see is murder murder, my mind state"
"Makes it too late for cops to try and stop the crime rate"
"All I see is murder murder, my mind state"
"Murder, murder, murder and kill, kill, kill"
"All I see is murder murder, my mind state"
"Makes it too late for cops to try and stop the crime rate"
"All I see is murder murder, my mind state"
"Murder, murder, murder and kill, kill, kill"

Left the keys in the van with a gat in each hand
Went up in Eastland and shot a policeman
Fuck a peace plan if a citizen bystands
The shit is in my hands, here's your lifespan
And for what your life's worth, this money is twice than
Grab a couple grand and lay up in Iceland
See, I'm a nice man, but money turned me to Satan
I'm thirsty for this green so bad I'm dehydratin'
Hurry up with the cash, bitch, I got a ride waitin'
Shot a man twice in the back when he tried skatin'
I want the whole pie, I won't be denied Nathan
Maybe I need my head inside straightened
Brain contemplatin', clean out the register
Dip before somebody catches ya
Or gets your description and sketches ya
Then connects you as the prime suspect
But I ain't set to flee the scene of the crime just yet
'Cause I got a daughter to feed
And two hundred dollars ain't enough to water the seed
The best thing would be for me to leave Taco Bell
And hit up Chess King and have the lady at the desk bring
Money from the safe in the back, stepped in wavin' a MAC
Co-operate and we can operate and save an attack
This bitch tried escapin' the jack
Grabbed her by the throat, it's murder she wrote
You barely heard a word as she choked
It wasn't nothin' for her to be smoked
Then I slammed her on her back 'til her vertebrae broke
Just then the pigs bust in yellin', "Freeze!"
But I'm already wanted for sellin' keys
And a bunch of other felonies from A to Z like spellin' bees
So before I dropped to the ground and fell on knees
I bust shots, they bust back
Hit me square in the chest, wasn't wearin' a vest

"All I see is murder murder, my mind state"
"Makes it too late for cops to try and stop the crime rate"
"All I see is murder murder, my mind state"
"Murder, murder, murder and kill, kill, kill"
"All I see is murder murder, my mind state"
"Makes it too late for cops to try and stop the crime rate"
"All I see is murder murder, my mind state"
"Murder, murder, murder and kill, kill, kill"

Left the house, pullin' out the drive, backin' out
Blew the back end out this lady's Jag, started blackin' out
Pulled the MAC-10 out
Stuck it in her face, "Shut your yackin' mouth
'Fore I blow the brain from out the back ya scalp!"
Drug her by her hair, smacked her up
Figured, "Fuck it—mug her while you're there," jacked her up
Stole her car and made a profit
Grabbed the tape from out the deck and loft it
Out the window like the girl in Set It Off did
Jetted off kid, stole the whip, now I'm a criminal
Drove it through somebody's yard, dove into they swimmin' pool
Climbed out and collapsed on the patio
I made it out alive, but I'm injured badly though
Parents screamin', "Johnny, go in and call the police!
Tell 'em there's a crazy man disturbing all of the peace!"
Tried to stall him at least long enough to let me leap up
Run in they crib and at least leave with some little cheap stuff
Actin' like they never seen nobody hit a lick before
Smashed the window, grabbed the Nintendo 64
When they sell out in stores, the price triples
I ran up the block jumpin' kids on tricycles
And collided with an eighty-year-old lady with groceries
There goes cheese, eggs, milk and Post Toasties
Stood up and started to see stars
Too many siren sounds, it seemed like a thousand police cars
Barely escaped, musta been some dumb luck
Jumped up and climbed the back of a movin' dump truck
But I think somebody seen me maybe
Plus I lost the damn Nintendo and I musta dropped a Beanie Baby
Fuck it, I give up, I'm surrounded in blue suits
Came out with a white flag hollerin', "Truce-truce!" (Don't shoot!)
And surrendered my weapon to cops
Wasn't me, it was the gangster rap and the peppermint Schnapps

"All I see is murder murder, my mind state"
"Makes it too late for cops to try and stop the crime rate"
"All I see is murder murder, my mind state"
"Murder, murder, murder and kill, kill, kill"

My brain's dead weight, I'm tryna get my head straight
But I can't figure out which Spice Girl I want to impregnate (Oh)
And Dr. Dre said, "Slim Shady, you a basehead" (Uh-uh)
"Then why's your face red? Man, you wasted"
Well, since age twelve, I felt like I'm someone else
'Cause I hung my original self from the top bunk with a belt
Got pissed off and ripped Pamela Lee's tits off
And smacked her so hard I knocked her clothes backwards like Kris Kross
I smoke a fat pound of grass, and fall on my ass
Faster than a fat bitch who sat down too fast
Come here, slut; "Shady, wait a minute, that's my girl, dawg"
I don't give a fuck, God sent me to piss the world off

Hi, my name is, what? My name is, who?
My name is, chka-chka, Slim Shady
Hi, my name is, huh? My name is, what?

My English teacher wanted to flunk me in junior high (Shh)
Thanks a lot, next semester I'll be thirty-five
I smacked him in his face with an eraser, chased him with a stapler
And stapled his nuts to a stack of paper (Owwwwwwww!)
Walked in the strip club, had my jacket zipped up
Flashed the bartender, then stuck my dick in the tip cup
Extraterrestrial, running over pedestrians in a spaceship
While they're screaming at me, "Let's just be friends"
Ninety-nine percent of my life, I was lied to
I just found out my mom does more dope than I do (Damn)
I told her I'd grow up to be a famous rapper
Make a record about doing drugs and name it after her
(Oh, thank you)
You know you blew up when the women rush your stands
And try to touch your hands like some screaming Usher fans
(Ahh, ahh, ahh)
This guy at White Castle asked for my autograph (Dude, can I get your autograph?)
So I signed it, "Dear Dave, thanks for the support, asshole"

Stop the tape, this kid needs to be locked away (Get him)
Dr. Dre, don't just stand there, operate
I'm not ready to leave, it's too scary to die (Fuck that)
I'll have to be carried inside the cemetery and buried alive
(Huh, yup)
Am I coming or going? I can barely decide
I just drank a fifth of vodka, dare me to drive? (Go ahead)
All my life I was very deprived
I ain't had a woman in years and my palms are too hairy to hide (Whoops)
Clothes ripped like the Incredible Hulk
I spit when I talk, I'll fuck anything that walks (Come here)
When I was little, I used to get so hungry I would throw fits
How you gonna breastfeed me, Mom? You ain't got no tits
I lay awake and strap myself in the bed
With a bulletproof vest on and shoot myself in the head (Bang)
'Cause I'm steaming mad (Grr)
And by the way, when you see my dad (Yeah?)
Tell him that I slit his throat in this dream I had

Hi, kids, do you like violence? (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Wanna see me stick Nine Inch Nails through each one of my eyelids? (Uh-huh)
Wanna copy me and do exactly like I did? (Yeah, yeah)

Scalpel

Sponge
Here
Wait, he's convulsing, he's convulsing
Ah
We're gonna have to shock him
Oh my God, oh my God
We're gonna have to shock him
Oh my God

These are the results of a thousand electric volts
A neck with bolts
Nurse, we're losin' him, check the pulse
A kid who refused to respect adults
Wore spectacles with taped frames and a freckled nose
A corny-lookin' white boy, scrawny and always ornery
'Cause I was always sick of brawny bullies pickin' on me
And I might snap, one day just like that
I decided to strike back, and flatten every tire on the bike rack
My first day in Junior High, this kid said
"It's you and I, three o'clock sharp, this afternoon you die"
I looked at my watch, it was 1:20
"I already gave you my lunch money
What more do you want from me?"
He said, "Don't try to run from me, you'll just make it worse"
My palms were sweaty, and I started to shake at first
Somethin' told me, "Try to fake a stomach ache, it works"
I screamed, "Ow, my appendix feel like they could burst
Teacher, teacher, quick, I need a naked nurse"
"What's the matter?"
"I don't know, my leg, it hurts"
"Leg? I thought you said it was your tummy"
"Oh, I mean it is, but I also got a bum knee"
"Mr. Mathers, the fun and games are over
And just for that stunt, you're gonna get some extra homework"
"But don't you wanna give me after school detention?"
"Nah, that bully wants to beat your ass and I'ma let him"

Brain damage, ever since the day I was born
Drugs is what they used to say I was on
They say I never knew which way I was goin'
But everywhere I go, they keep playin' my song
Brain damage, ever since the day I was born

Brain damage

Way before my baby daughter Hailie
I was harassed daily by this fat kid named DeAngelo Bailey
An eighth grader who acted obnoxious, 'cause his father boxes
So every day he'd shove me in the lockers
One day he came in the bathroom while I was pissin'
And had me in the position to beat me into submission
He banged my head against the urinal 'til he broke my nose
Soaked my clothes in blood, grabbed me and choked my throat
I tried to plead and tell him we shouldn't beef
But he just wouldn't leave
He kept chokin' me and I couldn't breathe
He looked at me and said, "You gonna die, honky"
The principal walked in and started helpin' him stomp me
(What's going on in here?)
I made 'em think they beat me to death
Holdin' my breath for like five minutes before they finally left
Then I got up and ran to the janitor's storage booth
Kicked the door hinge loose and ripped out the four-inch screws
Grabbed some sharp objects, brooms and foreign tools
This is for every time you took my orange juice
Or stole my seat in the lunchroom and drank my chocolate milk
Every time you tipped my tray and it dropped and spilt
I'm gettin' you back, bully, now once and for good
I cocked the broomstick back and swung hard as I could
And beat him over the head with it 'til I broke the wood
Knocked him down, stood on his chest with one foot
Made it home later that same day
Started readin' a comic, and suddenly everything became gray
I couldn't even see what I was tryin' to read
I went deaf and my left ear started to bleed
My mother started screamin', "What are you on, drugs?!
Look at you, you're gettin' blood all over my rug" (I'm sorry)
She beat me over the head with the remote control
Opened a hole and my whole brain fell out of my skull
I picked it up and screamed, "Look, bitch, what have you done?"
"Oh my God, I'm sorry, son"
Shut up, you cunt
I said fuck it, took it and stuck it back up in my head
Then I sewed it shut and put a couple of screws in my neck

Brain damage, ever since the day I was born
Drugs is what they used to say I was on
They say I never knew which way I was goin'
But everywhere I go, they keep playin' my song
Brain damage, ever since the day I was born
Drugs is what they used to say I was on
They say I never knew which way I was goin'
But everywhere I go, they keep playin' my song

Brain damage, it's brain damage
I got brain damage, it's brain damage
It's probably brain damage, it's brain damage
Brain damage, I got brain damage

(Just the two of us, just the two of us)
Baby, your dada loves you
And I'ma always be here for you
(Just the two of us, just the two of us)
No matter what happens
You're all I got in this world
(Just the two of us, just the two of us)
I would never give you up for nothin'
(Just the two of us, just the two of us)
Nobody in this world is ever gonna keep you from me
I love you

C'mon Hai-Hai, we goin' to the beach
Grab a couple of toys and let Dada strap you in the car seat
Oh, where's Mama? She's takin' a little nap in the trunk
Oh, that smell? Dada must've runned over a skunk
Now, I know what you're thinkin', it's kind of late to go swimmin'
But you know your Mama, she's one of those type of women
That do crazy things, and if she don't get her way, she'll throw a fit
Don't play with Dada's toy knife, honey, let go of it (No)
And don't look so upset, why you actin' bashful?
Don't you wanna help Dada build a sandcastle? (Yeah)
And Mama said she wants to show you how far she can float
And don't worry about that little boo-boo on her throat
It's just a little scratch, it don't hurt
Her was eatin' dinner while you were sleepin'
And spilled ketchup on her shirt
Mama's messy, ain't she? We'll let her wash off in the water
And me and you can play by ourselves, can't we?

Just the two of us, just the two of us
And when we ride
Just the two of us, just the two of us
Just you and I
Just the two of us, just the two of us
And when we ride
Just the two of us, just the two of us
Just you and I (See, honey)

There's a place called Heaven and a place called Hell
A place called prison and a place called jail
And Dada's probably on his way to all of 'em except one
'Cause Mama's got a new husband and a stepson
And you don't want a brother, do ya? (Nah)
Maybe when you're old enough
To understand a little better, I'll explain it to ya
But for now, we'll just say Mama was real, real bad
Was bein' mean to Dad and made him real, real mad
But I still feel sad that I put her on time out
Sit back in your chair, honey, quit tryna climb out
I told you it's okay, Hai-Hai, want a ba-ba?
Take a night-night? Na-na-boo, goo-goo-ga-ga?
Her make poo-poo ca-ca? Dada change your didee
Clean the baby up so her can take a nighty-nighty
Your dad'll wake her up as soon as we get to the water
'97 Bonnie and Clyde, me and my daughter

Just the two of us, just the two of us
And when we ride
Just the two of us, just the two of us
Just you and I
Just the two of us, just the two of us
And when we ride
Just the two of us, just the two of us
Just you and I

Wake up, sleepyhead, we're here, before we play
We're gonna take Mama for a little walk along the pier
Baby, don't cry, honey, don't get the wrong idea
Mama's too sleepy to hear you screaming' in her ear (Mama)
That's why you can't get her to wake, but don't worry
Dada made a nice bed for Mommy at the bottom of the lake
Here, you wanna help Dada tie a rope around this rock? (Yeah)
We'll tie it to her footsie then we'll roll her off the dock
Ready now, here we go, on the count of free
One, two, free, whee (whoosh)
There goes Mama, splashin' in the water
No more fightin' with Dad, no more restraining order
No more step-dada, no more new brother
Blow her kisses bye-bye, tell Mama you love her (Mommy)
Now we'll go play in the sand, build a castle and junk
But first, just help Dad with two more things out the trunk

Just the two of us, just the two of us
And when we ride
Just the two of us, just the two of us
Just you and I
Just the two of us, just the two of us
And when we ride
Just the two of us, just the two of us
Just you and I

(Just the two of us, just the two of us)
Just me and you, baby, is all we need in this world
(Just the two of us, just the two of us)
Just me and you
Your dada will always be here for you
Your dada's always gonna love you, remember that
If you ever need me, I'ma always be here for you
You ever need anything, just ask
Dada will be right there
Your dada loves you
I love you, baby

Okay, I'm going to attempt to drown myself
You can try this at home
You can be just like me
Mic check, one-two, we recordin'?

I'm cancerous, so when I diss, you wouldn't wanna answer this
If you responded back with a battle rap you wrote for Canibus
I'll strangle you to death, then I'll choke you again
And break your fuckin' legs 'til your bones poke through your skin
You beef with me, I'ma even the score equally
Take you on Jerry Springer and beat your ass legally
I get too blunted off of funny home grown
'Cause when I smoke out, I hit the trees harder than Sonny Bono
(Oh no) So if I said I never did drugs
That would mean I lie and get fucked more than the President does
Hillary Clinton tried to slap me and call me a pervert
I ripped her fuckin' tonsils out and fed her sherbet (Bitch)
My nerves hurt, and lately I'm on edge
Grabbed Vanilla Ice and ripped out (C'mere) his blond dreads (Fuck you)
Every girl I ever went out with has gone les'
Follow me and do exactly what the song says
Smoke weed, take pills, drop out of school, kill people
And drink, jump behind the wheel like it was still legal
I'm dumb enough to walk in a store and steal
So I'm dumb enough to ask for a date with Lauryn Hill
Some people only see that I'm white, ignorin' skill
'Cause I stand out like a green hat with a orange bill
But I don't get pissed, y'all don't even see through the mist
How the fuck can I be white? I don't even exist
I get a clean shave, bathe, go to a rave
Die from an overdose and dig myself up out of my grave
My middle finger won't go down, how do I wave?
And this is how I'm supposed to teach kids how to behave?

Now, follow me and do exactly what you see
Don't you wanna grow up to be just like me?
I slap women and eat shrooms, then OD
Now, don't you want to grow up to be just like me?

Me and Marcus Allen went over to see Nicole
When we heard a knock at the door, must've been Ron Gold
Jumped behind the door, put the orgy on hold
Killed them both, then smeared blood on the white Bronco
(We did it) My mind won't work if my spine don't jerk
I slapped Garth Brooks out of his rhinestone shirt
I'm not a player, just a ill rhyme sayer
That'll spray a aerosol can up at the ozone layer
My rap style's warped, I'm runnin' out the morgue
With your dead grandmother's corpse to throw it on your porch
Jumped in a Chickenhawk cartoon with a cape on
And beat up Foghorn Leghorn with an acorn
I'm 'bout as normal as Norman Bates with deformative traits
A premature birth that was four minutes late
Mother, are you there? I love you
I never meant to hit you over the head with that shovel (That shovel)
Will someone please explain to my brain
That I just severed the main vein with a chainsaw and I'm in pain?
I take a breather and sigh, either I'm high or I'm nuts
'Cause if you ain't tiltin' this room, neither am I
So when you see your mom with a thermometer shoved in her ass
Then it probably is obvious I got it on with her
'Cause when I drop this solo shit, it's over with
I bought Cage's tape, opened it, and dubbed over it

I came to the club drunk with a fake ID
Don't you wanna grow up to be just like me?
I've been with ten women who got HIV
Now, don't you wanna grow up to be just like me?
I got genital warts and it burns when I pee
Don't you wanna grow up to be just like me?
I tie a rope around my penis and jump from a tree
You probably wanna grow up to be just like me

I never meant to give you mushrooms, girl
I never meant to bring you to my world
But now you're sittin' in the corner, crying
And now it's my fault, my fault
I never meant to give you mushrooms, girl
I never meant to bring you to my world
But now you're sittin' in the corner, crying
And now it's my fault, my fault

I went to John's rave with Ron and Dave
And met a new wave blonde babe with half of her head shaved
A nurse aid who came to get laid and tied up
With first aid tape and raped on the first date (Ooh)
Susan, an ex-heroin addict who just stopped usin'
Who love booze and alternative music (What up?)
Told me she was going back into usin' again (Nah)
I said, "Wait, first try this hallucinogen
It's better than heroin, Henn, the booze and the gin
C'mere, let's go in here, who's in the den?"
"It's me and Kelly!"
"My bad" (Sorry)
"Let's try another room"
"I don't trust you"
"Shut up, slut, chew up this mushroom
This'll help you get in touch with your roots
We'll get barefoot, butt-naked, and run in the woods"
"Oh hell, I might as well try 'em, this party is so drab"
"Oh dag" (Mmm)
"I ain't mean for you to eat the whole bag"
"Huh?"

I never meant to give you mushrooms, girl
I never meant to bring you to my world
But now you're sittin' in the corner, crying
And now it's my fault, my fault (I'm sorry)
I never meant to give you mushrooms, girl
I never meant to bring you to my world
But now you're sittin' in the corner, crying
And now it's my fault, my fault

"Yo, Sue"
"Get away from me, I don't know you"
"Oh shoot, she's trippin'"
"I need to go puke" (Blehh)
"I wasn't tryna turn this into somethin' major
I just wanted to make you appreciate nature
Susan, stop crying, I don't hate ya
The world's not against you, I'm sorry your father raped ya
So what you had your little coochie in your dad's mouth?
That ain't no reason to start wiggin' and spaz out (Nah)"
She said, "Help me, I think I'm havin' a seizure"
I said, "I'm high too, bitch, quit grabbin' my T-shirt (Let go)
Would you calm down? You're startin' to scare me"
She said, "I'm 26 years old and I'm not married
I don't even have any kids and I can't cook"
"(Hello) I'm over here, Sue (Hi)
You're talking to the plant, look
We need to get to a hospital 'fore it's too late
'Cause I never seen no one eat as many 'shrooms as you ate"

I never meant to give you mushrooms, girl (Whoops)
I never meant to bring you to my world
But now you're sittin' in the corner, crying
And now it's my fault, my fault (It's an accident)
I never meant to give you mushrooms, girl
I never meant to bring you to my world
But now you're sittin' in the corner, crying
And now it's my fault, my fault

"Susan, wait, where you goin'? You better be careful"
"Leave me alone, dad, I'm sick of gettin' my hair pulled"
"I'm not your dad, quit trying to swallow your tongue
Want some gum? Put down the scissors
'Fore you do something dumb
I'll be right back, just chill, baby, please?
I gotta go find Dave, he's the one who gave me these
(I'ma kill him)
John, where's Dave at? Before I bash you"
"He's in the bathroom, I think he's takin' a crap, dude"
"Dave, pull up your pants, we need an ambulance
There's a girl upstairs talking to plants, choppin' her hair off
And there's only two days left of Spring Break
How long do these things take to wear off?"
"Well, it depends on how many you had"
"I took three, she ate the other 22 caps
Now she's upstairs cryin' out her eyeballs, drinking Lysol"
"She's gonna die, dude"
"I know and it's my fault"
"Oh my God"

I never meant to give you mushrooms, girl
I never meant to bring you to my world (I'm sorry)
But now you're sittin' in the corner, crying
And now it's my fault, my fault (What do I do?)
I never meant to give you mushrooms, girl
I never meant to bring you to my world
But now you're sittin' in the corner, crying
And now it's my fault, my fault

My God, I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry
Susan, please wake up, please
Please wake up, what are you doing?!
You're not dead, you're not dead
I know you're not dead
Wake up, Susan, wake up
Oh my God

(Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha) Yo, mic check
(Woo, shit) Testing
One, two, um, twelve
What up? What up? What up? (Outsiderz)
This is my dance song, can you hear me? (Outsiderz)
(Rah Digga, Young Zee, bust it, bust it)
Alright, ayy, turn my headphones up

My favorite color is red like the bloodshed
From Kurt Cobain's head when he shot himself dead
Women all grabbin' at my shish kabab
Bought Lauryn Hill's tape so her kids could starve
("I can't stand white people")
You thought I was ill and now I'm even more so
Shit, I got full-blown AIDS and a sore throat
I got a wardrobe with an orange robe
I'm in the fourth row, signin' autographs at your show
(Yo can you sign this right here?)
I just remembered that I'm absent-minded
Wait, I mean I've lost my mind, I can't find it
I'm freestylin' every verse that I spit
'Cause I don't even remember the words to my shit (Um, one, two)
I told the doc I need a change in sickness
And gave a girl herpes in exchange for syphilis
Put my LP on your Christmas gift list
You want to get high? Here, bitch, just sniff this

Cum on everybody (Get down tonight)
Cum on everybody (Get down tonight)
Cum on everybody (Get down tonight)
Cum on everybody (Get down tonight)

Cum on everybody (Get down tonight)

Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo
I tried suicide once and I'll try it again
That's why I write songs where I die at the end
'Cause I don't give a fuck like my middle finger was stuck
And I was wavin' it at everybody, screamin', "I suck" (I suck)
I go on stage in front of a sell-out crowd
And yell out loud, "All y'all get the hell out now"
Fuck rap, I'm givin' it up, y'all, I'm sorry
(But Eminem, this is your record release party)
I'm bored out of my gourd, so I took a hammer
And nailed my foot to the floorboard of my Ford
Guess I'm just a sick, sick bastard
Who's one sandwich short of a picnic basket (I ain't got it all)
One Excedrin tablet short of a full medicine cabinet
I feel like my head has been shredded like lettuce and cabbage (Oh)
And if you ever see a video for this shit
I'll probably be dressed up like a mummy with my wrists slit

Cum on everybody (Get down tonight)
Cum on everybody (Get down tonight)
Cum on everybody (Get down tonight)
Cum on everybody (Get down tonight)
Cum on everybody (Get down tonight)
Cum on everybody (Get down tonight)
Cum on everybody (Get down tonight)
Cum on everybody (Get down tonight)

Got bitches on my jock out in East Detroit
'Cause they think that I'm a motherfuckin' Beastie Boy
So I told 'em I was Mike D
They was like, "Gee, I don't know, he might be"
I told 'em, "Meet me at Kid Rock's next concert" (Oh really?)
I'll be standin' by the Loch Ness Monster" (Okay)
Peace out (Bye-bye)
Then I jetted to the weed house, smoked out
'Til I started bustin' freestyles, broke out
Then I dipped quick back to the crib, put on lipstick
Crushed up the Tylenol and ate it with a dipstick
Made a couple of crank calls collect (Brrrt)
"It's Ken Kaniff from Connecticut, can you accept?"
I want to make songs all the fellas dub
And murder every rich rapper that I'm jealous of
So just remember, when I bomb your set
Yo, I only cuss to make your mom upset

Cum on everybody (Get down tonight)
Cum on everybody (Get down tonight)
Cum on everybody (Get down tonight)
Cum on everybody (Get down tonight)
Cum on everybody (Get down tonight)
Cum on everybody (Get down tonight)
Cum on everybody (Get down tonight)
Cum on everybody (Get down tonight)

Whoa, a-get your hands in the air
And get to clappin' 'em and, like, back and forth
Because a-this is what you thought it wasn't
It be's the brothers representin' the Dirty Dozen
I be the F-R-O, the double G
And check out my man, he goes by the name of, um, er

Slim Shady, brain dead like Jim Brady
I'm a M-80, you little like that Kim lady
I'm buzzin', Dirty Dozen, naughty rotten rhymer
Cursin' at you players worse than Marty Schottenheimer
You wacker than the motherfucker you bit your style from
You ain't gon' sell two copies if you press a double album
Admit it, fuck it, while we comin' out in the open
I'm doin' acid, crack, smack, coke, and smokin' dope then
My name is Marshall Mathers, I'm an alcoholic (Hi, Marshall)
I have a disease and they don't know what to call it
Better hide your wallet 'cause I'm comin' up quick to strip your cash
Bought a ticket to your concert just to come and whip your ass
Bitch, I'm comin' out swingin' so fast it'll make your eyes spin
You gettin' knocked the fuck out like Mike Tyson (Pssh)
The proof is in the puddin', just ask DeShaun Holton
I'll slit your motherfuckin' throat worse than Ron Goldman

So when you see me on your block with two Glocks
Screamin', "Fuck the world" like 2Pac (I just don't give a fuck)
Talkin' that shit behind my back, dirty mackin'
Tellin' your boys that I'm on crack (I just don't give a fuck)
So put my tape back on the rack, go run and tell your friends
My shit is wack (I just don't give a fuck)
But see me on the street and duck
'Cause you gon' get stuck, stoned, and snuffed
('Cause I just don't give a fuck)

I'm nicer than Pete, but I'm on a search to crush a milkbone
I'm everlastin', I melt vanilla ice like silicone
I'm ill enough to just straight up diss you for no reason
I'm colder than snow season when it's 20 below freezin'
Flavor with no seasoning, this is the sneak preview
I'll diss your magazine and still won't get a weak review
I'll make your freak leave you, smell the Folgers crystals
This is lyrical combat, gentlemen, hold your pistols
But I form like Voltron and blast you with my shoulder missiles
Slim Shady, M&M was the old initials (Bye-bye)
Extortion, snortin', supportin' abortion
Pathological liar, blowin' shit outta proportion
The looniest, zaniest, spontaneous, sporadic
Impulsive thinker, compulsive drinker, addict
Half animal, half man
Dumpin' your dead body inside of a fuckin' trash can
With more holes than an afghan

So when you see me on your block with two Glocks
Screamin', "Fuck the world" like 2Pac (I just don't give a fuck)
Talkin' that shit behind my back, dirty mackin'

My shit is wack (I just don't give a fuck)
But see me on the street and duck
'Cause you finna get stuck, stoned, and snuffed
('Cause I just don't give a fuck)

Somebody let me out this limousine (Hey, let me out)
I'm a caged demon
On stage screamin' like Rage Against the Machine
I'm convinced I'm a fiend
Shootin' up while this record is spinnin'
Clinically brain-dead, I don't need a second opinion
Fuck droppin' a jewel, I'm flippin' a sacred treasure
I'll bite your motherfuckin' style just to make it fresher
I can't take the pressure, I'm sick of bitches
Sick of naggin' bosses bitchin' while I'm washin' dishes
In school, I never said much, too busy havin' a head rush
Doin' too much rush, had my face flushed like red blush
Then I went to Jim Beam, that's when my face grayed
Went to gym in eighth grade, raped the women's swim team
Don't take me for a joke, I'm no comedian
Too many mental problems got me snortin' coke and smokin' weed again
I'm goin' up over the curb, drivin' on the median
Finally made it home but I don't got the key to get in

So when you see me on your block with two Glocks
Screamin', "Fuck the world" like 2Pac (I just don't give a fuck)

Outsiderz, Pacewon, Young Zee (Fuck the entire world)
D.U.

Ayo, this song is dedicated
To all the happy people
All the happy people who have real nice lives
And have no idea what it's like to be broke as fuck

I feel like I'm walkin' a tight rope without a circus net
Poppin' Percocet, I'm a nervous wreck
I deserve respect but I work a sweat for this worthless check
I'm 'bout to burst this TEC at somebody to reverse this debt
Minimum wage got my adrenaline caged
Full of venom and rage, 'specially when I'm engaged
And my daughter's down to her last diaper, it's got my ass hyper
I pray that God answers, maybe I'll ask nicer
Watchin' ballers while they're flossin' in they Pathfinders
These overnight stars becomin' autograph-signers
We all long to blow up and leave the past behind us
Along with the small fries and average half-pinters
But player-haters turnin' bitch like they have vaginas
'Cause we see them dollar signs and let the cash blind us
Money'll brainwash you and leave your ass mindless
Them snakes slither in the grass, spineless

That's rock bottom, when this life makes you mad enough to kill
That's rock bottom, when you want somethin' bad enough to steal
That's rock bottom, when you feel like you've had it up to here
'Cause you mad enough to scream, but you're sad enough to tear
That's rock bottom, when this life makes you mad enough to kill
That's rock bottom, when you want somethin' bad enough to steal
That's rock bottom, when you feel like you've had it up to here
'Cause you mad enough to scream, but you're sad enough to tear

My life is full of empty promises and broken dreams
I'm hopin' things look up, but there ain't no job openings
I feel discouraged, hungry and malnourished
Livin' in this house with no furnace, unfurnished
And I'm sick of workin' dead-end jobs with lame pay
And I'm tired of bein' hired and fired the same day
But fuck it, if you know the rules to the game, play
'Cause when we die, we know we're all goin' the same way
'Cause it's cool to be the player, but it sucks to be the fan
When all you need is bucks to be the man, plus a luxury sedan
Or comfortable and roomy in a 6
But they threw me in the mix with all these gloomy lunatics
Who walk around depressed, and smoke a pound of cess a day
And yesterday went by so quick, it seems like it was just today
My daughter wants to throw the ball, but I'm too stressed to play
Live half my life and throw the rest away

That's rock bottom, when this life makes you mad enough to kill
That's rock bottom, when you want somethin' bad enough to steal
That's rock bottom, when you feel like you've had it up to here
'Cause you mad enough to scream, but you're sad enough to tear
That's rock bottom, when this life makes you mad enough to kill
That's rock bottom, when you want somethin' bad enough to steal
That's rock bottom, when you feel like you've had it up to here
'Cause you mad enough to scream, but you're sad enough to tear

There's people that love me and people that hate me (Yup)
But it's the evil that made me
This backstabbin', deceitful and shady (Mhm)
I want the money, the women, the fortune and fame
That means I end up burnin' in Hell, scorchin' in flame
That means I'm stealin' your checkbook and forgin' your name
This lifetime bliss for eternal torture and pain
'Cause right now, I feel like I've just hit the rock bottom
I've got problems, now everybody on my block's got 'em (Duh)
I'm screamin' like them two cops when 2Pac shot 'em
Holdin' two Glocks, hope your doors got new locks on 'em
My daughter's feet ain't got no shoes or socks on 'em
And them rings you're wearin' look like they got a few rocks on 'em
And while you flaunt 'em
I could be takin' 'em to shops to pawn 'em
I got a couple of rings and a brand-new watch, you want 'em?
'Cause I ain't never went gold off one song
I'm runnin' up on someone's lawn with guns drawn

That's rock bottom, when this life makes you mad enough to kill
That's rock bottom, when you want somethin' bad enough to steal
That's rock bottom, when you feel like you've had it up to here
'Cause you mad enough to scream, but you're sad enough to tear
That's rock bottom, when this life makes you mad enough to kill
That's rock bottom, when you want somethin' bad enough to steal
That's rock bottom, when you feel like you've had it up to here
'Cause you mad enough to scream, but you're sad enough to tear
That's rock bottom

(I don't know) Yes, man
(Why this world keeps turning) As the world turns
('Round and 'round) We all experience things in life
(But I wish it would stop and let me off right now)
Trials and tribulations
(I don't know) That we all must go through
(Why this world keeps turning) When someone wants to test us
('Round and 'round) When someone tries our patience
(But I wish it would stop and let me off right now)

I hang with a bunch of hippies and wacky tobacco planters
Who swallow lit roaches and light up like jack-o-lanterns
Outsidaz, baby, and we suin' the courts
'Cause we're dope as fuck and only get a 2 in The Source
Yo, they never should've booted me out of reform school (Uh-uh)
Deformed fool, takin' a shit in the warm pool
'Til they threw me out the Ramada Inn
I said, "It wasn't me, I got a twin"
Oh my God, it's you, not again (Ah)
It all started when my mother took my bike away
'Cause I murdered my guinea pig and stuck him in the microwave
After that, it was straight to the 40 ouncers
Slappin' teachers and jackin' off in front of my counselors
Class clown freshman, dressed like Les Nessman
Fuck the next lesson, I'll pass the test guessin'
And all the other kids said, "Eminem is a thizz head
He'll never last, the only class he'll ever pass is Phys Ed"
Maybe true, 'til I told this bitch in gym class
That she was too fat to swim laps, she need a Slim Fast
(Who, me?) Yeah, bitch, you so big
You walked into Vic Tanny's and stepped on Jenny Craig
(Well, I have never)
She picked me up to snap me like a skinny twig
Put me in a headlock, then I thought of my guinea pig
(Wait, wait, wait, wait)
I felt the evilness and started transformin' (Rrrahh)
It began stormin', I heard a bunch of cheerin' fans swarmin'
Grabbed that bitch by her hair, drug her across the ground (Come here, bitch)
And took her up to the highest divin' board and tossed her down
Sorry coach, it's too late to tell me stop
While I drop this bitch face down and watch her belly-flop

('Cause I don't know) As the world turns
(Why this world keeps turning) These are the days of our lives
('Round and 'round) These are the things that we must go through
(But I wish it would stop and let me off right now) Day by day

We drive around in million-dollar sports cars
While little kids hide this tape from their parents like bad report cards
Outsidaz, and we suin' the courts
'Cause we dope as fuck and only get a 2 in The Source (Yo)
Hypochondriac, hangin' out at the laundromat
Where all the raunchy, fat, white-trashy blondes be at
Dressed like a sailor, standin' by a pail of garbage
It's almost dark and I'm still tryna nail a trailer park bitch
I met a slut and said, "What up? It's nice to meet ya" (Hi)
"I'd like to treat you to a Faygo and a slice of pizza
But I'm broke as fuck
And I don't get paid 'til the first of next month (Sorry)
But if you'd care to join me, I was about to roll this next blunt
But I ain't got no weed, no Phillies or no papers
Plus, I'm a rapist and a repeated prison escapist
So give me all your money and don't try nothin' funny
'Cause you know your stinking ass is too fat to try to outrun me"
I went to grab my gun, that's when her ass put it on me (Stop)
With an uppercut, hit me with a basket of laundry (Ooh)
I fell through the glass doors, started causin' a scene
Slid across the floor and flew right into a washin' machine
Jumped up with a broken back, thank God I was smokin' crack
All day, and doped up on coke and smack
All I wanted to do was rape the bitch and snatch her purse
Now I wanna kill her, but yo, I gotta catch her first
Ran through Rally's parkin' lot and took a shortcut
Saw the house she ran up in and shot her fuckin' porch up
Kicked the door down to murder this divorced slut
Looked around the room
That's when I seen her bedroom door shut
"I know you're in there, bitch, I got my gun cocked
You might as well come out now"
She said, "Come in, it's unlocked"
I walked in and all I smelled was Liz Claiborne
And seen her spread across the bed naked, watchin' gay porn
She said, "Come here, big boy, let's get acquainted"
I turned around to run, twisted my ankle and sprained it
She came at me at full speed, nothin' could stop her
I shot her five times and every bullet bounced off her
I started to beg, "No, please let go"
But she swallowed my fuckin' leg whole like an egg roll
With one leg left, now I'm hoppin' around crippled
I grabbed my pocket knife and sliced off her right nipple
Just tryna buy me some time, then I remembered this magic trick
Duh-dah-duh-dah-duh-duh, go-go gadget dick
Whipped that shit out, and ain't no doubt about it
It hit the ground, caused an earthquake and power outage
I shouted, "Now, bitch, let's see who gets the best"
Stuffed that shit in, crooked and fucked that fat slut to death
Ow, ow (Come here, bitch)
Ow, ah (Come here, take this motherfuckin' dick, bitch, come here)

('Cause I don't know) And as we go along
(Why this world keeps turning) Throughout the days of our lives
('Round and 'round)
(But I wish it would stop and let me off right now)
We all face small obstacles
(I don't know) And challenges everyday
(Why this world keeps turning) That we must go through
('Round and 'round) These are the things
That surround us through our atmosphere
(But I wish it would stop and let me off right now)
(I don't know) Every day
(Why this world keeps turning) Every single day the world keeps turning
('Round and 'round) Keeps turning
(But I wish it would stop and let me off right now) Keeps turning
(I don't know why this world keeps turning)

Who came through with two Glocks to terrorize your borough? (Huh?)
Told you how to slap dips and murder your girl? (I did)
Gave you all the finger and told you to sit and twirl
Sold a billion tapes, and still screamed "Fuck the world"
(I'm Slim Shady) So come and kill me while my name's hot
And shoot me 25 times in the same spot (Ow)
I think I got a generation brainwashed
To pop pills and smoke pot 'til they brains rot
Stop they blood flow 'til they veins clot
I need a pain shot and a shot of plain Scotch
Purple haze and acid raindrops
Spike the punch at the party and drink pop
Shaved my armpits and wore a tank top
Bad Boy, I told you that I can't stop
You gotta make 'em fear you 'fore you make 'em feel you
So everybody buy my shit or I'ma come and kill you

I got mushrooms, I got acid, I got tabs and aspirin tablets
I'm your brother when you need some good weed to set you free
You know me, I'm your friend when you need a Mini Thin
(I'm Slim Shady, Shady, Shady, Shady) I'm Shady

I like happy things, I'm really calm and peaceful (Uh-huh)
I like birds, bees, I like people
I like funny things that make me happy and gleeful
Like when my teacher sucked my wee-wee in preschool
The ill type, I stab myself with a steel spike
While I blow my brain out just to see what it feels like
'Cause this is how I am in real life (Mhm)
I don't want to just die a normal death
I wanna be killed twice (Uh-huh)
I just wanna scare somebody with a gun threat
When they high off of drugs they haven't even done yet
So bring the money by tonight
'Cause your wife said this the biggest knife
She ever saw in her life (Help me, help me)
I try to keep it positive and play it cool
Shoot up the playground and tell the kids to stay in school
(Stay in school)
Cause I'm the one they can relate to and look up to better
Tonight I think I'll write my biggest fan a fuck-you letter

I got mushrooms, I got acid, I got tabs and aspirin tablets
I'm your brother when you need some good weed to set you free
You know me, I'm your friend when you need a Mini Thin
(I'm Slim Shady, Shady, Shady, Shady) I'm Shady

Yo, I'll listen to your demo tape and act like I don't like it
(Ah, that shit is wack)
Six months later, you'll hear your lyrics on my shit
(That's my shit)
People don't buy shit no more, they just dub it
That's why I'm still broke and had the number-one club hit
(Yup, uh-huh)
But they love it when you make your business public
So fuck it, I've got herpes while we on the subject (Uh-huh)
And if I told you I had AIDS, y'all would play it
'Cause you stupid motherfuckers think I'm playin' when I say it
Well, I do take pills, don't do speed
Don't do crack, don't do coke, I do smoke weed (Uh-huh)
Don't do smack, I do do shrooms, do drink beer (Yup)
I just wanna make a few things clear
My baby mama's not dead, she's still alive and bitching
And I don't have herpes, my dick's just itchin'
It's not syphilis, and as for being AIDS-infested
I don't know yet, I'm too scared to get tested

I got mushrooms, I got acid, I got tabs and aspirin tablets
I'm your brother when you need some good weed to set you free
You know me, I'm your friend when you need a Mini Thin
(I'm Slim Shady, Shady, Shady, Shady) I'm Shady

I told you I was Shady (Yup)
Y'all didn't wanna believe me (Mm-mm, mm-mm)
I'm Shady
And that's my name

I reckon you ain't familiar with these here parts
You know, there's a story behind that there saloon
20 years ago, two outlaws took this whole town over
Sheriffs couldn't stop 'em
Quickest damn gun-slingers I've ever seen
Got murdered in cold-blood
That old saloon there was their little home away from home
They say the ghosts of Bad and Evil still live in that tavern
And on a quiet night, you can still hear
The footsteps of Slim Shady and Royce Da 5'9"

I don't speak, I float in the air, wrapped in a sheet
I'm not a real person, I'm a ghost trapped in a beat
I translate when my voice is read through a seismograph
And the noise is spread
Picked up and transmitted through Royce's head (Uh)
Trap him in his room, possess him and hoist his bed
'Til the evilness flows through his blood like poisonous lead
Told him each one of his boys is dead (Oh)
I asked him to come to the dark side
He made a choice and said (Yo)
Who hard? Yo, I done heard worse
We can get in two cars and accelerate at each other
To see which one'll swerve first
Two blind bandits panic, whose mental capacity
Holds that of a globe on top of nine other planets
Kissed the cheek of the Devil, intelligence level
Is hellier than treble peakin' on speakers in the ghetto
Dismissal, I'm not a fair man, disgraced the race of an atheist
Interceptin' missiles with my bare hands like a patriot
One track sliced without swords, I buried the Christ corpse
In my past life, when the black knight mounted the white horse
And stay over-worked, it's like the Nazis and the Nation
Collaboratin', attemptin' to take over the Earth

'Cause this is what happens when Bad meets Evil
We hit the trees 'til we look like Vietnamese people
He's Evil, and I'm Bad like Steve Seagal
Above the law 'cause I don't agree with police either
Shit, me neither

We ain't eager to be legal
So please leave me with the keys to your Jeep Eagle
I breathe ether in three lethal amounts
While I stab myself in the knee with a diseased needle (Ah)
Releasin' rage on anybody in squeezin' range
Cold enough to make the seasons change into freezin' rain
(He's insane) No I'm not, I just want to shoot up
And I'm pissed off, 'cause I can't find a decent vein
The disaster with dreads, I'm bad enough to commit suicide
And survive long enough to kill my soul after I'm dead
When in danger, it's funny, actually my flavor's similar to a waiter
'Cause I serve any stranger with money
I spray a hundred, man, until they joint chains
While slippin' bullets at point-blank range like they was punches
Piss on a flag and burn it, murder you then come to your funeral
Service lobby and strangle your body to confirm it
Whippin' human ass, throwin' blows, crackin' jaws
With my fists wrapped in gauze, dipped in glue and glass
I'm blazin' MCs, at the same time amazin' MCs
Somehow, MCs ain't that eyebrow-raisin' to me
From all of angles of us, flash a MAC loud enough
To cast a avalanche and bust 'til volcanoes erupt

Hello? (Billy?)
Ayo, what's up? (We're comin' to get you)
Stop, they know it's us

I used to be a loudmouth, remember me? (Uh-uh)
I'm the one who burned your house down (Oh)
Well, I'm out now (Shit)
And this time, I'm comin' back to blow your house up
And I ain't gon' leave you with a window to jump out of
Give me two fat tabs and three shrooms
And you won't see me, like fat people in steam rooms
And when I go to hell and I'm gettin' ready to leave
I'ma put air in a bag and charge people to breathe

'Cause this is what happens when Bad meets Evil
And we hit the trees 'til we look like Vietnamese people
He's Evil, and I'm Bad like Steve Seagal
Against peaceful, see you in Hell for the sequel
(We'll be waiting) See you in Hell (Uh-huh)
Wall Street (Yup), Royce Da 5'9", Slim Shady (Uh)
See you in Hell for the sequel (Bye-bye)
Bad Meets Evil, what? (Until next time)

And so, that's the story of when Bad meets Evil
Two of the most wanted individuals in the county
Made Jesse James and Billy the Kid look like law-abiding citizens
It's too bad they had to go out the way they did
Got shot in the back comin' out of that old saloon
But their spirits still live on 'til this day
Shh, wait, did y'all hear that?

A lot of people ask me, am I afraid of death?
Hell yeah, I'm afraid of death
I don't want to die yet
A lot of people think that I worship the Devil
That I do all types of retarded shit
Look, I can't change the way I think
And I can't change the way I am
But if I offended you, good
'Cause I still don't give a fuck

I'm zonin' off of one joint, stoppin' the limo
Hopped in the window, shoppin' a demo at gunpoint
A lyricist without a clue, what year is this?
Fuck a needle, here's a sword, body pierce with this
Livin' amuck, never givin' a fuck
Give me the keys, I'm drunk, and I've never driven a truck
But I smoke dope in the cab
I'll stab you with the sharpest knife I can grab
Come back the next week and re-open your scab (Yeah)
A killer instinct runs in the blood
Emptyin' full clips and buryin' guns in the mud
I've calmed down now, I was heavy once into drugs
I could walk around straight for two months with a buzz
My brain's gone, my soul's worn, my spirit is torn
The rest of my body's still bein' operated on
I'm ducked the fuck down while I'm writin' this rhyme
'Cause I'm probably gonna get struck with lightnin' this time

For all the weed that I've smoked, yo, this blunt's for you
To all the people I've offended, yeah, fuck you too
To all the friends I used to have, I miss my past
But the rest of you assholes can kiss my ass
For all the drugs that I've done, yo, I'm still gon' do
To all the people I've offended, yeah, fuck you too
For every time I reminisce, yo, I miss my past
But I still don't give a fuck, y'all can kiss my ass

I walked into a gunfight with a knife to kill you
And cut you so fast, when your blood spilled, it was still blue
I'll hang you 'til you dangle, and chain you with both ankles
And pull you apart from both angles
I wanna crush your skull 'til your brains leak out of your veins
And bust open like broken water mains
So tell Saddam not to bother with makin' another bomb
'Cause I'm crushin' the whole world in my palm
Got your girl on my arm, and I'm armed with a firearm
So big my entire arm is a giant firebomb
Buy your mom a shirt with a Slim Shady iron-on
And the pants to match ("Here, Momma, try 'em on")
I get imaginative with a mouth full of adjectives
A brain full of adverbs, and a box full of laxatives
(Shittin' on rappers) Causing hospital accidents
God help me, before I commit some irresponsible acts again

For all the weed that I've smoked, yo, this blunt's for you
To all the people I've offended, yeah, fuck you too
For all the friends I used to have, I miss my past
But the rest of you assholes can kiss my ass
For all the drugs that I've done, yo, I'm still gon' do
To all the people I've offended, yeah, fuck you too
For every time I reminisce, yo, I miss my past
But I still don't give a fuck, y'all can kiss my ass

I wanted an album so rugged nobody could touch it
Spent a million a track and went over my budget (Oh shit)
Now, how in the fuck am I supposed to get out of debt?
I can't rap anymore, I just murdered the alphabet
Drug sickness got me doin' some bugged twitches
I'm withdrawin' from crack so bad my blood itches
I don't rap to get the women, fuck bitches
Give me a fat slut that cooks and does dishes
Never ran with a clique, I'm a posse
Kamikaze, strappin' a motherfuckin' bomb across me
From the second I was born, my momma lost me
I'm a cross between Manson, Esham and Ozzy
I don't know why the fuck I'm here in the first place
My worst day on this Earth was my first birthday
Retarded? What did that nurse say?
Brain damage? Fuck, I was born durin' an earthquake

For all the weed that I've smoked, yo, this blunt's for you
To all the people I've offended, yeah, fuck you too
To all the friends I used to have, yo, I miss my past
But the rest of you assholes can kiss my ass
For all the drugs that I've done, yo, I'm still gon' do
To all the people I've offended, yeah, fuck you too
For every time I reminisce, I miss my past
But I still don't give a fuck, y'all can kiss my ass

When I was just a little baby boy,
My momma used to tell me these crazy things
She used to tell me my daddy was an evil man,
She used to tell me he hated me

But then I got a little bit older
And I realized, she was the crazy one
But there was nothing I could do or say to try to change it
'Cause that's just the way she was

They said I can't rap about being broke no more
They ain't say I can't rap about coke no more
Slut, you think I won't choke no whore
'Til the vocal cords don't work in her throat no more?!

These motherfuckers are thinking I'm playing
Thinking I'm saying the shit 'cause I'm thinking it just to be saying it
Put your hands down bitch, I ain't gon' shoot you
I'mma pull you to this bullet, and put it through you

Shut up slut, you're causing too much chaos
Just bend over and take it like a slut, OK Ma?
"Oh, now he's raping his own mother,
Abusing a whore, snorting coke, and we gave him the Rolling Stone cover?"

You're goddamn right bitch, and now it's too late
I'm triple platinum and tragedies happen in two states
I invented violence, you vile venomous volatile bitches
Vain Vicodin, vrinn vrinn, vrinnn!

Texas Chainsaw, left his brains all
Dangling from his neck, while his head barely hangs on
Blood, guts, guns, cuts
Knives, lives, wives, nuns, sluts

Bitch I'mma kill you! You don't wanna fuck with me
Girls neither – you ain't nothing but a slut to me
Bitch I'mma kill you! You ain't got the balls to beef
We ain't gon' never stop beefing I don't squash the beef

You better kill me! I'mma be another rapper dead
For popping off at the mouth with shit I shouldn't have said
But when they kill me – I'm bringing the world with me
Bitches too! You ain't nothing but a girl to me

I said you don't wanna fuck with Shady ('cause why?)
'Cause Shady will fucking kill you
I said you don't wanna fuck with Shady (why?)
'Cause Shady will fucking kill you

Bitch I'mma kill you!
Like a murder weapon, I'mma conceal you
In a closet with mildew, sheets, pillows and film you
Fuck with me, I been through hell, shut the hell up!
I'm tryna develop these pictures of the Devil to sell 'em

I ain't "acid rap", but I rap on acid
Got a new blow-up doll and just had a strap-on added
Whoops! Is that a subliminal hint? No!
Just criminal intent to sodomize women again
Eminem offend? No! Eminem'll insult
And if you ever give in to him, you give him an impulse
To do it again, then, if he does it again
You'll probably end up jumping out of something up on the 10th

Bitch I'mma kill you, I ain't done this ain't the chorus
I ain't even drug you in the woods yet to paint the forest
A bloodstain is orange after you wash it three or four times in a tub
But that's normal ain't it Norman?

Serial killer hiding murder material
In a cereal box on top of your stereo
Here we go again, we're out of our medicine
Out of our minds, and we want in yours, let us in

Or I'mma kill you! You don't wanna fuck with me
Girls neither – you ain't nothing but a slut to me
Bitch I'mma kill you! You ain't got the balls to beef
We ain't gon' never stop beefing I don't squash the beef

You better kill me! I'mma be another rapper dead
For popping off at the mouth with shit I shouldn't have said
But when they kill me I'm bringing the world with me
Bitches too! You ain't nothing but a girl to me

I said you don't wanna fuck with Shady ('cause why?)
'Cause Shady will fucking kill you
I said you don't wanna fuck with Shady (why?)
'Cause Shady will fucking kill you

Eh-heh, know why I say these things?
'Cause ladies' screams keep creeping in Shady's dreams
And the way things seem, I shouldn't have to pay these shrinks
This eighty Gs a week to say the same things tweece!

Twice? Whatever, I hate these things
Fuck shots! I hope the weed'll outweigh these drinks
Motherfuckers want me to come on their radio shows
Just to argue with 'em cause their ratings stink?

Fuck that! I'll choke radio announcer to bouncer
From fat bitch to all seventy-thousand pounds of her
From principal to the student body and counselor
From in-school to before school to out of school

I don't even believe in breathing
I'm leaving air in your lungs
Just to hear you keep screaming for me to seep it
OK, I'm ready to go play
I got the machete from O.J.
I'm ready to make everyone's throats ache

You faggots keep egging me on
'Til I have you at knifepoint, then you beg me to stop?
Shut up! Give me your hands and feet
I said shut up when I'm talking to you
You hear me? Answer me!

Or I'mma kill you! You don't wanna fuck with me
Girls neither – you ain't nothing but a slut to me
Bitch I'mma kill you! You don't got the balls to beef
We ain't gon' never stop beefing I don't squash the beef

You better kill me! I'mma be another rapper dead
For popping off at the mouth with shit I shouldn't have said
But when they kill me – I'm bringing the world with me
Bitches too! You ain't nothing but a girl to me
Bitch I'mma kill you!

You don't wanna fuck with Shady ('cause why?)
'Cause Shady will fucking kill you
I said you don't wanna fuck with Shady (why not?)
'Cause Shady will fucking kill you..

I'm just playing, ladies
You know I love you

My tea's gone cold I'm wondering why I got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window and I can't see at all
And even if I could it'd all be gray, but your picture on my wall
It reminds me, that it's not so bad, it's not so bad
My tea's gone cold I'm wondering why I got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window and I can't see at all
And even if I could it'd all be gray, but your picture on my wall
It reminds me, that it's not so bad, it's not so bad

Dear Slim, I wrote you but you still ain't calling
I left my cell, my pager, and my home phone at the bottom
I sent two letters back in autumn, you must not've got 'em
There probably was a problem at the post office or something
Sometimes I scribble addresses too sloppy when I jot 'em
But anyways; fuck it, what's been up? Man, how's your daughter?
My girlfriend's pregnant, too, I'm bout to be a father
If I have a daughter, guess what I'mma call her?
I'mma name her Bonnie
I read about your Uncle Ronnie, too, I'm sorry
I had a friend kill himself over some bitch who didn't want him
I know you probably hear this every day, but I'm your biggest fan
I even got the underground shit that you did with Skam
I got a room full of your posters and your pictures, man
I like the shit you did with Rawkus, too, that shit was phat
Anyways, I hope you get this, man, hit me back
Just to chat, truly yours, your biggest fan
This is Stan

My tea's gone cold I'm wondering why I got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window and I can't see at all
And even if I could it'd all be gray, but your picture on my wall
It reminds me, that it's not so bad, it's not so bad

Dear Slim, you still ain't called or wrote, I hope you have a chance
I ain't mad I just think it's fucked up you don't answer fans
If you didn't wanna talk to me outside your concert
You didn't have to, but you could've signed an autograph for Matthew
That's my little brother man, he's only six years old
We waited in the blistering cold for you
For four hours and you just said, "No"
That's pretty shitty man you're like his fucking idol
He wants to be just like you man, he likes you more than I do
I ain't that mad though, I just don't like being lied to
Remember when we met in Denver you said if I'd write you
You would write back see I'm just like you in a way
I never knew my father neither
He used to always cheat on my mom and beat her
I can relate to what you're saying in your songs
So when I have a shitty day, I drift away and put 'em on
'Cause I don't really got shit else so that shit helps when I'm depressed
I even got a tattoo of your name across the chest
Sometimes I even cut myself to see how much it bleeds
It's like adrenaline, the pain is such a sudden rush for me
See everything you say is real, and I respect you 'cause you tell it
My girlfriend's jealous 'cause I talk about you 24/7
But she don't know you like I know you Slim, no one does
She don't know what it was like for people like us growing up
You gotta call me man, I'll be the biggest fan you'll ever lose
Sincerely yours, Stan
P.S.
We should be together, too

My tea's gone cold I'm wondering why I got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window and I can't see at all
And even if I could it'd all be gray, but your picture on my wall
It reminds me, that it's not so bad, it's not so bad

Dear Mister I'm-Too-Good-To-Call-Or-Write-My-Fans,
This'll be the last package I ever send your ass
It's been six months and still no word. I don't deserve it?
I know you got my last two letters;
I wrote the addresses on 'em perfect
So this is my cassette I'm sending you, I hope you hear it
I'm in the car right now, I'm doing 90 on the freeway
Hey Slim, I drank a fifth of vodka, you dare me to drive?
You know the song by Phil Collins "In the Air Tonight"
About that guy who could've saved that other guy from drowning
But didn't, then Phil saw it all, then at a show he found him?
That's kinda how this is, you could've rescued me from drowning
Now it's too late. I'm on a thousand downers now, I'm drowsy
And all I wanted was a lousy letter or a call
I hope you know I ripped all of your pictures off the wall
I loved you, Slim, we could've been together, think about it
You ruined it now, I hope you can't sleep and you dream about it
And when you dream I hope you can't sleep and you scream about it
I hope your conscience eats at you and you can't breathe without me
See, Slim,—shut up bitch! I'm trying to talk!
Hey, Slim, that's my girlfriend screaming in the trunk,
But I didn't slit her throat, I just tied her up. See, I ain't like you
'Cause if she suffocates she'll suffer more, and then she'll die, too
Well, gotta go, I'm almost at the bridge now
Oh shit, I forgot, how am I supposed to send this shit out?

My tea's gone cold I'm wondering why I got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window and I can't see at all
And even if I could it'd all be gray, but your picture on my wall
It reminds me, that it's not so bad, it's not so bad

Dear Stan, I meant to write you sooner but I've just been busy
You said your girlfriend's pregnant now, how far along is she?
Look, I'm really flattered you would call your daughter that
And here's an autograph for your brother
I wrote it on the Starter cap
I'm sorry I didn't see you at the show, I must've missed you
Don't think I did that shit intentionally just to diss you
But what's this shit you said about you like to cut your wrists, too?
I say that shit's just clowning , dawg
C'mon! How fucked up is you?
You got some issues, Stan, I think you need some counseling
To help your ass from bouncing off the walls when you get down some
And what's this shit about us meant to be together?
That type of shit'll make me not want us to meet each other
I really think you and your girlfriend need each other
Or maybe you just need to treat her better
I hope you get to read this letter, I just hope it reaches you in time
Before you hurt yourself, I think that you'll be doing just fine
If you relax a little, I'm glad I inspire you but, Stan
Why are you so mad? Try to understand, that I do want you as a fan
I just don't want you to do some crazy shit
I seen this one shit on the news a couple weeks ago that made me sick
Some dude was drunk and drove his car over a bridge
And had his girlfriend in the trunk, and she was pregnant with his kid
And in the car they found a tape, but they didn't say who it was to
Come to think about it, his name was... it was you
Damn!

(I never knew I, knew I, knew I'd)
(I never knew I, knew I, knew I'd) Mic check, one-two
(I never knew I, knew I, knew I'd) Who would've knew?
(I never knew I, knew I, knew I'd) Who would've known?
(I never knew I, knew I, knew I'd) Fuck would've thought?
(I never knew I, knew I, knew I'd) Motherfucker comes out
(I never knew I, knew I, knew I'd) Sells a couple of million records
(I never knew I, knew I, knew I'd) And these motherfuckers hit the ceiling
(I never knew I'd)

I don't do black music, I don't do white music (No)
I make fight music for high school kids
I put lives at risk when I drive like this
I put wives at risk with a knife like this
Shit, you probably think I'm in your tape deck now
I'm in the back seat of your truck with duct tape stretched out
Ducked the fuck way down, waitin' to straight jump out
Put it over your mouth, and grab you by the face — what now?
Oh, you want me to watch my mouth
How? Take my fuckin' eyeballs out and turn them around?
Look, I'll burn your fuckin' house down, circle around
And hit the hydrant, so you can't put your burnin' furniture out
I'm sorry, there must be a mix-up
You want me to fix up lyrics
While our President gets his dick sucked?
Fuck that! Take drugs, rape sluts
Make fun of gay clubs, men who wear make-up
Get aware, wake up, get a sense of humor
Quit tryin' to censor music
This is for your kid's amusement (the kids!)
But don't blame me when little Eric jumps off of the terrace
You shoulda been watchin' him, apparently you ain't parents

'Cause I never knew I, knew I would get this big
I never knew I, knew I'd affect this kid
I never knew I'd get him to slit his wrist
I never knew I'd get him to hit this bitch
I never knew I, knew I would get this big
I never knew I, knew I'd affect this kid
I never knew I'd get him to slit his wrist
I never knew I'd get him to hit this bitch

So who's bringin' the guns in this country? (Hm?)
I couldn't sneak a plastic pellet gun
Through customs over in London
And last week I seen this Schwarzenegger movie
Where he's shootin' all sorts of these motherfuckers with an Uzi
I see these three little kids up in the front row
Screaming, "Go!" with their seventeen-year-old uncle
I'm like, guidance?!
Ain't they got the same moms and dads
Who got mad when I asked if they liked violence?
And told me that my tape taught 'em to swear?
What about the make-up
You allow your twelve-year-old daughter to wear? (Hm?)
So tell me that your son doesn't know any cuss words
When his bus driver's screamin' at him, fuckin' him up worse
(Go sit the fuck down, you little fucking prick!)
And "fuck" was the first word I ever learned
Up in the third grade, flippin' the gym teacher the bird (Look!)
So read up 'bout how I used to get beat up
Peed on, be on free lunch
And changed school every three months
My life's like kind of what my wife's like (What?)
Fucked up after I beat her fuckin' ass every night: Ike
So how much easier would life be
If nineteen million motherfuckers grew to be just like me?

'Cause I never knew I, knew I would get this big
I never knew I, knew I'd affect this kid
I never knew I'd get him to slit his wrist
I never knew I'd get him to hit this bitch
I never knew I, knew I would get this big
I never knew I, knew I'd affect this kid
I never knew I'd get him to slit his wrist
I never knew I'd get him to hit this bitch

I never knew I, knew I'd have a new house or a new car
A couple years ago I was more poorer than you are
I don't got that bad of a mouth, do I?
Fuck! Shit! Ass! Bitch! Cunt! Shooby-de-doo-wop! (Oops)
Skibbedy-be-bop, a Christopher Reeves
Sonny Bono, skis, horses and hittin' some trees (Hey)
How many retards'll listen to me
And run up in the school shootin' when they're pissed at a tea
cher? Her? Him? Is it you? Is it them?
"Wasn't me, Slim Shady said to do it again!"
Damn, how much damage can you do with a pen?
Man, I'm just as fucked up as you would've been
If you would've been in my shoes, who would've thought
Slim Shady would be somethin' that you would've bought?
That would've made you get a gun and shoot at a cop
I just said it, I ain't know if you'd do it or not

'Cause I never knew I, knew I would get this big
I never knew I, knew I'd affect this kid
I never knew I'd get him to slit his wrist
I never knew I'd get him to hit this bitch
I never knew I, knew I would get this big
I never knew I, knew I'd affect this kid
I never knew I'd get him to slit his wrist
I never knew I'd get him to hit this bitch

How the fuck was I supposed to know?

Whatever
Dre, just let it run
Aiyyo turn the beat up a little bit
Aiyyo... this song is for anyone... fuck it
Just shut up and listen, aiyyo

I sit back with this pack of Zig Zags and this bag
Of this weed it gives me the shit needed to be
The most meanest MC on this on this Earth
And since birth I've been cursed with this curse to just curse
And just blurt this berserk and bizarre shit that works
And it sells and it helps in itself to relieve
All this tension dispensing these sentences
Getting this stress that's been eating me recently off of this chest
And I rest again peacefully (peacefully)
But at least have the decency in you
To leave me alone, when you freaks see me out
In the streets when I'm eating or feeding my daughter
Do not come and speak to me (speak to me)
I don't know you and no
I don't owe you a motherfucking thing
I'm not Mr. N'Sync, I'm not what your friends think
I'm not Mr. Friendly, I can be a prick
If you tempt me my tank is on empty (is on empty)
No patience is in me and if you offend me
I'm lifting you 10 feet (lifting you 10 feet)... in the air
I don't care who was there and who saw me just jaw you
Go call you a lawyer, file you a lawsuit
I'll smile in the courtroom and buy you a wardrobe
I'm tired of all you (of all you)
I don't mean to be mean, but that's all I can be it's just me

And I am, whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
In the paper, the news every day I am
Radio won't even play my jam
'Cause I am, whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
In the paper, the news every day I am
I don't know, it's just the way I am

Sometimes I just feel like my father
I hate to be bothered
With all of this nonsense it's constant
And, "Oh, it's his lyrical content
the song 'Guilty Conscience' has gotten such rotten responses"
And all of this controversy circles me
And it seems like the media immediately
Points a finger at me (finger at me)
So I point one back at 'em, but not the index or pinkie
Or the ring or the thumb, it's the one you put up
When you don't give a fuck, when you won't just put up
With the bullshit they pull, 'cause they full of shit too
When a dude's getting bullied and shoots up his school
And they blame it on Marilyn (on Marilyn)... and the heroin
Where were the parents at? And look where it's at
Middle America, now it's a tragedy
Now it's so sad to see, an upper class city
Having this happening (this happening)
Then attack Eminem 'cause I rap this way (rap this way)
But I'm glad 'cause they feed me the fuel that I need for the fire
To burn and it's burning and I have returned

And I am, whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
In the paper, the news every day I am
Radio won't even play my jam
'Cause I am, whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
In the paper, the news every day I am
I don't know it's just the way I am

I'm so sick and tired of being admired
That I wish that I would just die or get fired
And dropped from my label, let's stop with the fables
I'm not gonna be able to top on "My Name is... "
And pigeon-holed into some pop-py sensation
That got me rotation at rock'n'roll stations
And I just do not got the patience (got the patience)
To deal with these cocky Caucasians who think
I'm some wigger who just tries to be black 'cause I talk
With an accent, and grab on my balls, so they always keep asking
The same fucking questions (fucking questions)
What school did I go to, what hood I grew up in
The why, the who what when, the where, and the how
'Til I'm grabbing my hair and I'm tearing it out
'Cause they driving me crazy (driving me crazy)... I can't take it
I'm racing, I'm pacing, I stand and I sit
And I'm thankful for every fan that I get
But I can't take a shit, in the bathroom
Without someone standing by it
No, I won't sign your autograph
You can call me an asshole I'm glad

'Cause I am, whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
In the paper, the news every day I am
Radio won't even play my jam
'Cause I am, whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
In the paper, the news every day I am
I don't know, it's just the way I am

May I have your attention please?
May I have your attention please?
Will the real Slim Shady please stand up?
I repeat, will the real Slim Shady please stand up?
We're gonna have a problem here

Y'all act like you never seen a white person before
Jaws all on the floor like Pam and Tommy just burst in the door
And started whooping her ass worse than before
They first were divorced, throwing her over furniture (Ah!)
It's the return of the... "Ah, wait, no way, you're kidding
He didn't just say what I think he did, did he?"
And Dr. Dre said... nothing, you idiots!
Dr. Dre's dead, he's locked in my basement! (Ha-ha!)
Feminist women love Eminem
[*Vocal turntable: chigga chigga chigga*]
"Slim Shady, I'm sick of him
Look at him, walking around grabbing his you-know-what
Flipping the you-know-who." "Yeah, but he's so cute though!"
Yeah, I probably got a couple of screws up in my head loose
But no worse, than what's going on in your parents' bedrooms
Sometimes, I wanna get on TV and just let loose, but can't
But it's cool for Tom Green to hump a dead moose
"My bum is on your lips, my bum is on your lips"
And if I'm lucky, you might just give it a little kiss
And that's the message that we deliver to little kids
And expect them not to know what a woman's clitoris is
Of course they gonna know what intercourse is
By the time they hit fourth grade
They got the Discovery Channel, don't they?
"We ain't nothing but mammals.." Well, some of us cannibals
Who cut other people open like cantaloupes [*slurp*]
But if we can hump dead animals and antelopes
Then there's no reason that a man and another man can't elope
[*ewww!*] But if you feel like I feel, I got the antidote
Women wave your pantyhose, sing the chorus and it goes

'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?

'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?

Will Smith don't gotta cuss in his raps to sell records
Well I do, so fuck him and fuck you too!
You think I give a damn about a Grammy?
Half of you critics can't even stomach me, let alone stand me
"But Slim, what if you win, wouldn't it be weird?"
Why? So you guys could just lie to get me here?
So you can, sit me here next to Britney Spears?
Yo Shit, Christina Aguilera better switch me chairs
So I can sit next to Carson Daly and Fred Durst
And hear 'em argue over who she gave head to first
Little bitch, put me on blast on MTV
"Yeah, he's cute, but I think he's married to Kim, hee-hee!"
I should download her audio on MP3
And show the whole world how you gave Eminem VD
I'm sick of you little girl and boy groups, all you do is annoy me
So I have been sent here to destroy you
And there's a million of us just like me
Who cuss like me; who just don't give a fuck like me
Who dress like me; walk, talk and act like me
It just might be the next best thing but not quite me!

'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?

'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?

I'm like a head trip to listen to, cause I'm only giving you
Things you joke about with your friends inside your living room
The only difference is I got the balls to say it
In front of y'all and I don't gotta be false or sugarcoated at all
I just get on the mic and spit it
And whether you like to admit it [*err*] I just shit it
Better than ninety percent of you rappers out can
Then you wonder how can kids eat up these albums like Valiums
It's funny; 'cause at the rate I'm going when I'm thirty
I'll be the only person in the nursing home flirting
Pinching nurses asses when I'm jacking off with Jergens
And I'm jerking but this whole bag of Viagra isn't working
And every single person is a Slim Shady lurking
He could be working at Burger King, spitting on your onion rings
[*hach*] Or in the parking lot, circling
Screaming "I don't give a fuck!"
With his windows down and his system up
So, will the real Shady please stand up?
And put one of those fingers on each hand up?
And be proud to be outta your mind and outta control
And one more time, loud as you can, how does it go?

'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?

'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?

'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?

'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?

Ha ha
Guess there's a Slim Shady in all of us
Fuck it, let's all stand up

Remember me? Seven executions
Remember me? I have no remorse
Remember me? I'm high-powered
Remember me? I drop bombs, like Hiroshima

For this one, they scream "X, you retarded?!"
'Cause I grab the mic and get down like syndrome
Hide and roam into the masses
Without boundaries, which qualifies me
For the term "universal" without no rehearsal
I leak words that's controversial
Like I'm not the one you wanna contest, see
'Cause I'll hit your ass like the train did that bitch
That got banned from TV, heavyweight getup
Hit you, watch your whole head split up
Loco is the motion, we comin' through
Hollow-tips is the lead the .45 threw

Remember me? Throw ya guns in the air!
Remember me? Slam! Slam!
Remember me? Nigga, back the fuck up!
Remember me? Chka-chka-Onyx!

Niggas that take no for an answer get told no
Yeah, I been told no, but it was more like "No! No! No!"
Life's a bitch, met her, fuck you if you let her
Better come better than better to be a competitor
This vet is ahead of the shit, it's all redder, you deader and deader
A medic instead of the cheddars and credda
Settle vendetta with metal Beretta from ghetto to ghetto
Evidence, nope, never leave a shred of
I got the soul of every rapper in me, love me or hate me
My mom's got raped by the industry and made me
I'm the illest nigga ever, I told you
I get more pussy than them dyke bitches Total
Want beef, nigga? Pbbt, you better dead that shit
My name should be Can't-Believe-That-Nigga-Said-That-Shit
Probably sayin' he ain't a killer, but I'm killin' myself
Smoke death, fuck bitches raw on the kitchen floor
So think what I'ma do to you, have done to you
Got niggas in my hood who'd do that shit for a blunt or two
What you wanna do? Cocksuckers, we Glock busters
'Til the cops cuff us, gon' start ruckus and drop blockbusters
Round the clock hustlers, you cannot touch us
I'm gettin' wires, niggas wantin' me dead
Wantin' my head, you think it could be somethin' I said?

Remember me? I just don't give a fuck!
Remember me? Yeah, fuck you too!
Remember me? I'm low down and I'm shifty!
Remember me? I'm Shady!

When I go out, I'ma go out shootin'
I don't mean when I die, I mean when I go out to the club, stupid!
I'm tryin' to clean up my fuckin' image
So I promised the fuckin' critics I wouldn't say "fucking" for six minutes
Six minutes, Slim Shady, you're on!
My baby's mom, bitch made me an angry blonde
So I made me a song, killed her and put Hailie on
I may be wrong, I keep thinkin' these crazy thoughts
In my cranium, but I'm stuck with a crazy mom
Is she really on as much dope as you say she's on?
Came home and somebody musta broke in the back window
And stole two loaded machine guns and both of my trench coats
Six sick dreams of picnic scenes
Two kids, sixteen, with M-16s and ten clips each
And them shits reach through six kids each
And Slim gets blamed in Bill Clint's speech to fix these streets?!
Fuck that! Pbbt, you faggots can vanish to volcanic ash
And reappear in hell with a can of gas and a match
Aftermath, Dre, grab the gat, show 'em where it's at!
(What the fuck you starin' at, nigga?)

Don't you remember me?!
Remember me?!
Remember me?!
Remember me!! (Slim Shady!)

That's why they call me Slim Shady (I'm back)
I'm back (I'm back), I'm back
That's why they call me Slim Shady (I'm back)
I'm back (I'm back), I'm back
That's why they call me Slim Shady (I'm back)

I murder a rhyme, one word at a time
You never heard of a mind as perverted as mine
You better get rid of that 9, it ain't gonna help
What good's it gonna do against a man that strangles himself?
I'm waitin' for Hell, like hell, shit, I'm anxious as hell
Manson, you're safe in that cell, be thankful it's jail
I used to be my mommy's little angel at twelve
Thirteen, I was puttin' shells in a gauge on a shelf
I used to get punked and bullied on my block
'Til I cut a kitten's head off and stuck it in this kid's mailbox
(Hey Ma', Ma'!)
I used to give a fuck, now I could give a fuck less
What do I think of success? It sucks, too much press
I'm stressed, too much cess, depressed, too upset
It's just too much mess, I guess I must just blew up quick (Yes)
Grew up quick (No), was raised right
Whatever you say is wrong, whatever I say's right
You think of my name now whenever you say, "Hi"
Became a commodity 'cause I'm W-H-I-
T-E, ‘cause MTV was so friendly
To me, can't wait 'til Kim sees me
Now, is it worth it? Look at my life, how is it perfect?
Read my lips, bitch! What, my mouth isn't workin'?
You hear this finger? Oh, it's upside down
Here, let me turn this motherfucker up right now

That's why they call me Slim Shady (I'm back)
I'm back (I'm back), I'm back
That's why they call me Slim Shady (I'm back)
I'm back (I'm back), I'm back
That's why they call me Slim Shady (I'm back)
I'm back (I'm back), I'm back
That's why they call me Slim Shady (Shady!)
I'm back (I'm back), I'm back

I take each individual degenerate's head and reach into it
Just to see if he's influenced by me, if he listens to music
And if he feeds into this shit, he's an innocent victim
And becomes a puppet on the string of my tennis shoe
[*Scratches*] My name is Slim Shady
I been crazy way before radio didn't play me
The sensational [*scratch*] "Back is the incredible!"
With Ken Kaniff, who just finds the men edible
It's Ken Kaniff on the Internet
Tryin' to lure your kids with him into bed
It's a sick world we live in these days
"Slim, for Pete's sakes, put down Christopher Reeve's legs!"
Geez, you guys are so sensitive
"Slim, it's a touchy subject, try and just don't mention it."
Mind with no sense in it, fried schizophrenic
Whose eyes get so squinted, I'm blind from smoke in 'em
With my windows tinted
With nine limos rented, doin' lines of coke in 'em
With a bunch of guys hoppin' out, all high and indo-scented
And that's where I get my name from, that's why they call me—

They call me Slim Shady (I'm back)
I'm back (I'm back), I'm back
That's why they call me Slim Shady (I'm back)
I'm back (I'm back), I'm back
That's why they call me Slim Shady (I'm back)
I'm back (I'm back), I'm back
That's why they call me Slim Shady (I'm back)
I'm back (I'm back), I'm back (Back)

I take seven kids from Columbine, stand 'em all in line
Add an AK-47, a revolver, a 9
A MAC-11 and it oughta solve the problem of mine
And that's a whole school of bullies shot up all at one time
‘Cause I'm Shady, they call me as crazy
As the world was over this whole Y2K thing
And by the way, N'Sync, why do they sing?
Am I the only one who realizes they stink?
Should I dye my hair pink and care what y'all think
Lip sync and buy a bigger size of earrings?
It's why I tend to block out when I hear things
‘Cause all these fans screamin' is makin' my ears ring (Ah!)
So I just throw up a middle finger and let it linger
Longer than the rumor that I was stickin' it to Christina
‘Cause if I ever stuck it to any singer in showbiz
It'd be Jennifer Lopez and, Puffy, you know this
I'm sorry, Puff, but I don't give a fuck
If this chick was my own mother, I'd still fuck her with no rubber
And cum inside her and have a son and a new brother
At the same time and just say that it ain't mine—what's my name?

I'm Slim Shady (I'm back)
I'm back (I'm back), I'm back
That's why they call me Slim Shady (I'm back)
I'm back (I'm back), I'm back
That's why they call me Slim Shady (I'm back)
I'm back (I'm back), I'm back
They call me Slim Shady (I'm back)
I'm back (I'm back), I'm back

Guess who's b-back, back
Gue-gue-guess who's back (hi, Mom!)
[*scratch*] Guess who's back
[*scratch*] Gue— [*scratch*] guess who's back
D-12 [*scratch*] guess who's back
Gue, gue-gue-gue, guess who's back
Dr. Dre [*scratch*] guess who's back
Back back [*scratch*] back [*scratch*]
Slim Shady, 2001
I'm blew out from this blunt [*sighs*] fuck

You know I just don't get it
Last year I was nobody
This year I'm selling records
Now everybody wants to come around like I owe em something
Heh, the fuck you want from me, ten million dollars?
Get the fuck out of here

You see I'm, just Marshall Mathers (Marshall Mathers)
I'm just a regular guy
I don't know why all the fuss about me (fuss about me)
Nobody ever gave a fuck before
All they did was doubt me (did was doubt me)
Now everybody wanna run their mouth
And try to take shots at me (take shots at me)

Yo, you might see me jogging, you might see me walking
You might see me walking a dead rottweiler dog
With its head chopped off in the park with a spiked collar
Hollering at him 'cause the son of a bitch won't quit barking
(Grrrr, arf arf) Or leaning out a window, with a cocked shotgun
Driving up the block in the car that they shot 'Pac in
Looking for Big's killers, dressing ridiculous
Blue and red like I don't see what the big deal is
Double barrel twelve gauge bigger than Chris Wallace
Pissed off, 'cause Biggie and 'Pac just missed all this
Watching all these cheap imitations get rich off 'em
And get dollars that shoulda been theirs like they switched wallets
And amidst all this Crist' popping and wrist watches
I just sit back and just watch and just get nauseous
And walk around with an empty bottle of Remy Martin
Starting shit like some 26-year-old skinny Cartman ("God damnit!")
I'm anti-Backstreet and Ricky Martin
Whose instinct's to kill N'Sync, don't get me started
These fuckin' brats can't sing and Britney's garbage
What's this bitch retarded? Gimme back my sixteen dollars
All I see is sissies in magazines smiling
Whatever happened to wiling out and being violent?
Whatever happened to catching a good old-fashioned
Passionate ass-whooping and getting your shoes coat and your hat tooken?
New Kids on the Block, sucked a lot of dick
Boy/girl groups make me sick
And I can't wait 'til I catch all you faggots in public
I'ma love it.. (hahaha)
Vanilla Ice don't like me (uh-uh)
Said some shit in Vibe to spite me (yup)
Then went and dyed his hair just like me (hehe)
A bunch of little kids wanna swear just like me
And run around screaming, "I don't care, just bite me" (nah nah)
I think I was put here to annoy the world
And destroy your little 4-year-old boy or girl
Plus I was put here to put fear in faggots who spray Faygo Root Beer
And call themselves "Clowns" 'cause they look queer
Faggy 2 Dope and Silent Gay
Claiming Detroit, when y'all live twenty miles away (fuckin punks)
And I don't wrestle, I'll knock you fuckin faggots the fuck out
Ask 'em about the club they was at when they snuck out
After they ducked out the back when they saw us and bugged out
(Ah!) Ducked down and got paint balls shot at they truck, blaow!
Look at y'all running your mouth again
When you ain't seen a fuckin Mile Road, South of 10
And I don't need help, from D12, to beat up two females
In make-up, who may try to scratch me with Lee Nails
"Slim Anus," you damn right, Slim Anus
I don't get fucked in mine like you two little flaming faggots!

'Cause I'm just Marshall Mathers (Marshall Mathers)
I'm not a wrestler guy
I'll knock you out if you talk about me (you talk about me)
Come and see me on the streets alone
If you assholes doubt me (assholes doubt me)
And if you wanna run your mouth
Then come take your best shot at me (your best shot at me)

Is it because you love me that y'all expect so much of me?
You little groupie bitch, get off me, go fuck Puffy
Now because of this blonde mop that's on top
Of this fucked up head that I've got, I've gone pop?
The underground just spunned around and did a 360
Now these kids diss me and act like some big sissies
"Oh, he just did some shit with Missy
So now he thinks he's too big to do some shit with MC Get-Bizzy"
My fuckin bitch mom's suing for ten million
She must want a dollar for every pill I've been stealing
Shit, where the fuck you think I picked up the habit?
All I had to do was go in her room and lift up her mattress
Which is it bitch, Mrs. Briggs or Ms. Mathers?
It doesn't matter your [attorney Fred Gibson's a] faggot!
Talking about I fabricated my past
He's just aggravated I won't ejaculate in his ass (Uh!)
So tell me, what the hell is a fella to do?
For every million I make, another relative sues
Family fighting and fussing over who wants to invite me to supper
All of a sudden I got 90 some cousins (Hey it's me!)
A half-brother and sister who never seen me
Or even bothered to call me until they saw me on TV
Now everybody's so happy and proud
I'm finally allowed to step foot in my girlfriend's house
Hey-hey! And then to top it off, I walked to the newsstand
To buy this cheap-ass little magazine with a food stamp
Skipped to the last page, flipped right fast
And what do I see? A picture of my big white ass
OK, let me give you motherfuckers some help:
Uh, here double XL, double XL
Now your magazine shouldn't have so much trouble to sell
Ah fuck it, I'll even buy a couple myself

'Cause I'm just Marshall Mathers (Marshall Mathers)
I'm just a regular guy
I don't know why all the fuss about me (fuss about me)
Nobody ever gave a fuck before
All they did was doubt me (did was doubt me)
Now everybody wanna run their mouth
And try to take shots at me (take shots at me)

Because I'm just Marshall Mathers (Marshall Mathers)
I'm just a regular guy
I don't know why all the fuss about me (fuss about me)
Nobody ever gave a fuck before
All they did was doubt me (did was doubt me)
Now everybody wanna run their mouth
And try to take shots at me (take shots at me)

Back when Mark Wahlberg was Marky Mark
(fuckin' faggot)
This is how we used to make the party start
We used to mix Hen' with Bacardi Dark
And when it kicks in you can hardly talk

And by the sixth gin you're gon' probably crawl
And you'll be sick then and you'll probably barf
And my prediction is you're gon' probably fall
Either somewhere in the lobby or the hallway wall

And everything's spinning
You're beginnin' to think women
Are swimming in pink linen again in the sink
Then in a couple of minutes
That bottle of Guinness is finished
You are now allowed to officially slap bitches

You have the right to remain violent and start wilin'
Start a fight with the same guy that was smart-eyein' you
Get in your car, start it, and start drivin'
Over the island and cause a 42-car pile-up

Earth calling, pilot to co-pilot
Looking for life on this planet, sir, no sign of it
All I can see is a bunch of smoke flyin'
And I'm so high that I might die if I go by it
Let me out of this place
I'm outta place
I'm in outer space
I've just vanished without a trace
I'm going to a pretty place
Now where the flowers grow
I'll be back in an hour or so

'Cause every time I go to try to leave
Someone keeps pullin' on my sleeve
I don't wanna, but I gotta stay
These drugs really got a hold of me

'Cause every time I try to tell them "No"
They won't let me ever let them go
I'm a sucker all I gotta say
These drugs really got a hold of me

In third grade, all I used to do
Was sniff glue through a tube and play Rubik's cube
17 years later I'm as rude as Jude
Scheming on the first chick with the hugest boobs

I've got no game
And every face looks the same
They've got no name
So I don't need game to play

I just say whatever I want to whoever I want
Whenever I want, wherever I want, however I want

However I do show some respect to few
This ecstasy's got me standing next to you
Getting sentimental as fuck spillin' guts to you
We just met but I think I'm in love with you

But you're on it too
So you tell me you love me too
Wake up in the morning like
"Yo, what the fuck we do?"
I gotta go bitch
You know I got stuff to do
'Cause if I get caught cheatin' then I'm stuck with you

But in the long run
These drugs are probably going to catch up sooner or later
But fuck it, I'm on one
So let's enjoy
Let the X destroy your spinal cord
So it's not a straight line no more
'Til we walk around looking like some wind-up dolls
Shit's sticking out of our backs like a dinosaur
Shit, six hits won't even get me high no more
So bye for now
I'm going to try to find some more

'Cause every time I go to try to leave
Someone keeps pullin' on my sleeve
I don't wanna, but I gotta stay
These drugs really got a hold of me

'Cause every time I try to tell them "No"
They won't let me ever let them go
I'm a sucker all I gotta say
These drugs really got a hold of me

That's the sound of a bottle when it's hollow
When you swallow it all wallow and drown in your sorrow
And tomorrow you're probably gonna wanna do it again
What's a little spinal fluid between you and a friend? Screw it
And what's a little bit of alcohol poisoning?
And what's a little fight?
Tomorrow you'll be boys again
It's your life
Live it however you wanna
Marijuana is everywhere
Where was you brought up?
It don't matter as long as you get where you're going
‘Cause none of this shit's gonna mean shit where we're goin'
They tell you to stop, but you just sit there ignoring
Even though you wake up feeling like shit every morning

But you're young
You've got a lot of drugs to do
Girls to screw
Parties to crash
Sucks to be you
If I could take it all back now, I wouldn't
I would have did more shit that people said that I shouldn't
But I'm all grown up now and upgraded and graduated
Did better drugs and updated
But I've still got a lot of growing up to do
I've still got a whole lot of throwing up to spew

But when it's all said and done I'll be 40
Before I know it with a 40 on the porch telling stories
With a bottle of Jack
Two grandkids in my lap
Babysitting for Hailie while Hailie's out getting smashed

'Cause every time I go to try to leave
Someone keeps pullin' on my sleeve
I don't wanna, but I gotta stay
These drugs really got a hold of me

'Cause every time I try to tell them "No"
They won't let me ever let them go
I'm a sucker all I gotta say
These drugs really got a hold of me

'Cause every time I go to try to leave
Someone keeps pullin' on my sleeve
I don't wanna, but I gotta stay
These drugs really got a hold of me

'Cause every time I try to tell them "No"
They won't let me ever let them go
I'm a sucker all I gotta say
These drugs really got a hold of me

Drugs really got a hold of me
Really got a hold of me
'Cause drugs really got a hold of me
They really got a hold of me

(Kill, kill, kill)
Dahh-dum, dahh-dum... dum
Dahh-dum, dahh-dum, duh-da-da-da-da
(Kill, kill, kill)
Dahh-dum, dahh-dum... dum
Dahh-dum, dahh-dum, dumm
(Kill, kill, kill)

He's mentally ill from Amityville
He'll accidentally kill your family still
Thinkin' he won't, goddammit he will
He's mentally ill from Amityville

I get lifted and spin 'til I'm half-twisted
Feet planted and stand with a grin full of chapped lipstick
Pen full of ink, think sinful and rap sick shit
Shrink, pencil me in for my last visit
Drink gin 'til my chin's full of splashed whiskers
Hash, whiskey, and ash 'til I slap bitches
Ask Bizzy, he's been here the past six years
Mash with me again and imagine this

He's mentally ill from Amityville
He'll accidentally kill your family still
Thinkin' he won't, goddammit he will
He's mentally ill from Amityville
He's mentally ill from Amityville
He'll accidentally kill your family still
Thinkin' he won't, goddammit he will
He's mentally ill from Amityville

I fucked my cousin in his asshole, slit my mother's throat
Guess who Slim Shady just signed to Interscope
My little sister's birthday, she'll remember me
For a gift I had ten of my boys take her virginity
And bitches know me as a horny-ass freak
Their mother wasn't raped, I ate her pussy while she was sleep
Pissy-drunk, throwin' up in the urinal
(You fuckin' homo!) That's what I said at my dad's funeral

He's mentally ill from Amityville
He'll accidentally kill your family still
Thinkin' he won't, goddammit he will
He's mentally ill from Amityville
He's mentally ill from Amityville
He'll accidentally kill your family still
Thinkin' he won't, goddammit he will
He's mentally ill from Amityville

That's why the city is filled with a bunch of fuckin' idiots still (Still)
That's why the first motherfucker poppin' some shit, he gets killed (Killed)
That's why we don't call it Detroit, we call it Amityville (Ville)
You can get capped after just havin' a cavity filled (Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!)
That's why we're crowned the murder capital still (Still)
This ain't Detroit, this is motherfuckin' Hamburger Hill (Hill)
We don't do drive-bys, we park in front of houses and shoot (Shoot)
And when the police come we fuckin' shoot it out with 'em too (Too)
That's the mentality here (Here), that's the reality here (Here)
Did I just hear somebody say they wanna challenge me here? (Huh?)
While I'm holdin' a pistol with this many calibers here? (Here)
Plus a registration that just made this shit valid this year? (Year)
'Cause once I snap, I can't be held accountable for my actions
That's when accidents happen (Happen), when a thousand bullets come at your house
And collapse the foundation around you and they found you
And your family in it; goddammit, he meant it when he told you

He's mentally ill from Amityville
He'll accidentally kill your family still
Thinkin' he won't, goddammit he will
He's mentally ill from Amityville
He's mentally ill from Amityville
He'll accidentally kill your family still
Thinkin' he won't, goddammit he will
He's mentally ill from Amityville

Yeah, what up, Detroit?
Nu-uh, nu-uh nuh, no, he didn't
They didn't do it again (What-what, you what?)
You shitted on these niggas two times, Dr. Dre?
Oh, fo' sho'
Uh-uh, naw, you smell that?
This is special right here (What-what, what-what-what?)
Yeah, it's a toast to the boogie, baby, uh
To the boogie-oogie-oogie
Yeah, ya know, what's crackin', Dre?

Just let me lay back and kick some old simplistic pimp shit
On Slim's shit, and start riots like Limp Bizkit
Best throw on "Guilty Conscience" at concerts
And watch mosh pits 'til motherfuckers knock each other unconscious (Watch out, nigga)
Some of these crowds that Slim draws
Is rowdy as Crenshaw Boulevard, when it's packed and full of cars
Some of these crowds me and Snoop draw
Is niggas from Crenshaw, from Long Beach to South Central
Whoa, not these niggas again
These grown-ass ignorant men with hair-triggers again (Shit)
You and what army could harm me?
D.R.E. and Shady with Doggy from Long Beach (Westside)
Came a long way to makin' these songs play
It'll be a wrong move to stare at me the wrong way
I got a long Uz' and I carry it all day
Sometimes it's like a nightmare just bein' Andre
But I…

Somehow, some way
Hello, nigga, you know about Dogg-ay (Snoop Dogg)
And let me cut these niggas up and show 'em where the fuck I'm comin' from
I get the party crackin' from the shit that I be spittin', son (Yeah)
Hit-and-run, get it done, get the funds, split and run (Watch out)
Got about fifty guns and I love
All of 'em the same, bang-bang (Word up)
Damn, baby girl, what's your name? (What's your name?)
I forgot, what'd you say it was? Damn, a nigga buzzed (Fucked up)
Hangin' in the club with my nephew Eminem (What's up, Slim?) What up, Cuz? (What up, Snoop?)
The Great White American Hope (Uh-huh)
Done hooked up with the king of the motherfuckin' West Coast, baby

And you don't really wanna fuck with me
Only nigga that I trust is me
Fuck around and make me bust this heat
That's the devil, they always wanna dance

I'm the Head Nigga In Charge, I'm watchin' you move
You're found dead in your garage with ten o'clock news coverage
Gotta love it 'cause I expose the façade
Your little lungs is too small to hotbox with God
All jokes aside, come bounce with us
Standin' over you with a 12 gauge about to bust
It's like ashes to ashes and dust to dust
I might leave in a body bag, but never in cuffs
So who do you trust? They just not rugged enough
When things get rough, I'm in the club shootin' with Puff
Bitch, please! You must have a mental disease
Assume the position and get back down on your knees
Come on

And you don't really wanna fuck with me
Only nigga that I trust is me
Fuck around and make me bust this heat
That's the devil, they always wanna dance
And you don't really wanna fuck with me
Only nigga that I trust is me
Fuck around and make me bust this heat
That's the devil, they always wanna dance

Aw, naw, big Slim Dogg
Eighty pound balls (What?), dick six-inch long (Mm)
Back up in the heezy, baby
He's Shady (He's so crazy!) (Ha-ha-ha)
Give me the mic, let me recite 'til Timothy White
Pickets outside the Interscope offices every night
What if he's right? I'm just a criminal makin' a livin' off of the world's misery
What in the world gives me the right
To say what I like and walk around flippin' the bird?
Livin' the urban life like a white kid from the burbs
Dreamin' at night of screamin' at Mom, schemin' to leave
Run away from home and grow to be as evil as me
I just want you all to notice me, and people to see
That, somewhere deep down, there's a decent human being in me
It just can't be found, so the reason you've been seeing this me
Is 'cause this is me now, the recent dude who's being this mean
So when you see me dressin' up like a nerd on TV
Or heard the CD usin' the fag word so freely
It's just me bein' me; here, want me to tone it down?
Suck my fuckin' dick, you faggot! You happy now?
Look here, I start some trouble everywhere that I go (That I go)
Ask the bouncers in the club 'cause they know ('Cause they know)
I start some shit, they throw me out the back door (The back door)
Come back and shoot the club up with a .44 (A .44)

And you don't really wanna fuck with me
Only nigga that I trust is me
Fuck around and make me bust this heat
That's the devil, they always wanna dance
And you don't really wanna fuck with me
Only nigga that I trust is me
Fuck around and make me bust this heat
That's the devil, they always wanna dance

2001 and forever
Slim Shady, Dr. Dre
Snoop Dogg, X to the Z
Nate Dogg, come on, yeah

Aww look at daddy's baby girl
That's daddy's baby
Little sleepy head
Yesterday I changed your diaper
Wiped you and powdered you.
How did you get so big?
Can't believe it now you're two
Baby, you're so precious
Daddy's so proud of you
Sit down, bitch
If you move again I'll beat the shit out of you

Don't make me wake this baby
She don't need to see what I'm about to do
Quit crying, bitch, why do you always make me shout at you?
How could you
Just leave me and love him out the blue?
Oh, what's the matter Kim?
Am I too loud for you?
Too bad, bitch, you're gonna finally hear me out this time
At first, I'm like all right
You wanna throw me out? That's fine!
But not for him to take my place, are you out your mind?
This couch, this TV, this whole house is mine!
How could you let him sleep in our bed?
Look at, Kim
Look at your husband now!
(No!)
I said look at him!
He ain't so hot now is he?
Little punk!
(Why are you doing this?)
Shut the fuck up!
(You're drunk! You're never gonna get away with this!)
You think I give a fuck!
Come on we're going for a ride, bitch
(No!)
Sit up front
(Well, I can't just leave Hailie alone. What if she wakes up?)
We'll be right back
Well, I will, you'll be in the trunk

So long
Bitch, you did me so wrong
I don't wanna go on
Living in this world without you

So long
Bitch, you did me so wrong
I don't wanna go on
Living in this world without you

You really fucked me, Kim
You really did a number on me
Never knew me cheating on you would come back to haunt me
But we was kids then, Kim, I was only 18
That was years ago
I thought we wiped the slate clean
That's fucked up!
(I love you!)
Oh, God, my brain is racing
(I love you!)
What are you doing?
Change the station I hate this song!
Does this look like a big joke?
(No!)
There's a four-year-old boy lyin' dead with a slit throat
In your living room, ha-ha
What you think I'm kiddin' you?
You loved him, didn't you?
(No!)
Bullshit, you bitch, don't fucking lie to me
What the fuck's this guy's problem on the side of me?
Fuck you, asshole, yeah, bite me
Kim, Kim!
Why don't you like me?
You think I'm ugly, don't you?
(It's not that!)
No, you think I'm ugly
(Baby)
Get the fuck away from me, don't touch me
I hate you! I hate you!
I swear to god, I hate you
Oh, my god, I love you
How the fuck could you do this to me?
(Sorry!)
How the fuck could you do this to me?

So long
Bitch, you did me so wrong
I don't wanna go on
Living in this world without you

So long
Bitch, you did me so wrong
I don't wanna go on
Living in this world without you

Come on, get out
(I can't, I'm scared)
I said get out, bitch!
(Let go of my hair.
Please don't do this, baby
Please I love you, look we can just take Hailie and leave)
Fuck you
You did this to us
You did it, it's your fault
Oh, my God, I'm crackin' up
Get a grip, Marshall
Hey remember the time we went to Brian's party?
And you were like so drunk that you threw up all over Archie
That was funny, wasn't it?
(Yes!)
That was funny, wasn't it?
(Yes!)
See it all makes sense, doesn't it?
You and your husband have a fight
One of you tries to grab a knife
And during the struggle he accidentally gets his Adam's apple sliced
(No!)
And while this is goin' on
His son just woke up and he just walks in
She panics and he gets his throat cut
(Oh, my God!)
So now they both dead and you slash your own throat
So now it's double homicide and suicide with no note
I should have known better when you started to act weird
We could've... Hey! Where you going? Get back here!
You can't run from me, Kim
It's just us, nobody else!
You're only making this harder on yourself
Ha! Ha! Got'cha!
(Ah!)
Ha! Go ahead, yell!
Here I'll scream with you!
Ah, somebody help!
Don't you get it, bitch, no one can hear you?
Now shut the fuck up and get what's coming to you
You were supposed to love me
Now bleed! Bitch, bleed!
Bleed! Bitch, bleed! Bleed!

So long
Bitch, you did me so wrong
I don't wanna go on
Living in this world without you

So long
Bitch, you did me so wrong
I don't wanna go on
Living in this world without you

Chem-le-le-le-le-le-le-le, le-le, le-le
Chem-le-le-le-ne-miah-nuf-niah, ne-nish, ne-ne (Translation:)
So you can suck my dick if you don't like my shit
'Cause I was high when I wrote this, so suck my dick!

Two pills I pop, 'til my pupils swell up like two pennies
I'm Clint Eastwood in his mid-twenties
A young-ass man with a trash can, strapped to the back
Of his ass so the rats can't chew through his last pants
I'm like a mummy at night, fightin' with bright lightnin'
And frightened with five little white Vicodin pills bitin' him
I'm like a fuckin' wasp in the hospital, lost
Stingin' the fuck outta everything I come across in the halls
I light a candle and place it up on the mantel
Grab a knife at the blade and stab you with the fuckin' handle
So when you find yourself wrapped up in the blinds, hurtin'
(Bitch, it's too late)
'Cause once you're hung from the drapes, it's curtains

So you can suck my dick if you don't like my shit
'Cause I was high when I wrote this, so suck my dick!
'Cause I don't give a fuck if you don't like my shit
'Cause I was high when I wrote this, so suck my dick!

So you can suck my dick if you don't like my shit
'Cause I was high when I wrote this, so suck my dick!
'Cause I don't give a fuck if you don't like my shit
'Cause I was high when I wrote this, so suck my dick!

Ha-ha! Suck my motherfuckin' dick!
D12, Dirty-motherfuckin'-Dozen
Nasty like a stank slut bitch with thirty fuckin' husbands
Bizarre Kid, Swifty McVay, the Kon Artis
The Kuniva, Derty Harry, and Slim Shady

A lot of people ask me stupid fucking questions
A lot of people think that what I say on a record or what I talk about on a record, that I actually do in real life or that I believe in it
Or if I say that I wanna kill somebody that I'm actually gonna do it or that I believe in it
Well, shit, if you believe that then I'll kill you
You know why?
'Cause I'm a criminal

Criminal
You're goddamn right
I'm a criminal
Yeah, I'm a criminal

My words are like a dagger with a jagged edge
That'll stab you in the head
Whether you're a fag or lez
Or a homosex, hermaph or a trans-a-vest
Pants or dress
Hate fags? The answer's "yes"

Homophobic? Nah, you're just heterophobic
Staring at my jeans, watching my genitals bulging
That's my motherfucking balls
You'd better let go of 'em
They belong in my scrotum
You'll never get hold of 'em

"Hey, it's me, Versace
Whoops, somebody shot me!
And I was just checking the mail."
Get it? Checking the 'male'?

How many records you expecting to sell
After your second LP sends you directly to jail?
C'mon! Relax guy, I like gay men
Right, Ken? Give me an "amen". A-men!

Please Lord, this boy needs Jesus
Heal this child, help us destroy these demons
Oh, and please send me a brand new car
And a prostitute while my wife's sick in the hospital

Preacher preacher, fifth grade teacher
You can't reach me, my mom can't neither
You can't teach me a goddamn thing
'Cause I watch TV, and Comcast cable
And you ain't able to stop these thoughts
You can't stop me from topping these charts
And you can't stop me from dropping each March
With a brand new CD for these fucking retards
And to think, it's just little ol' me
Mr. Don't-Give-A-Fuck still won't leave

I'm a criminal
'Cause every time I write a rhyme
These people think it's a crime
To tell 'em what's on my mind
I guess I'm a criminal
But I don't gotta say a word
I just flip 'em the bird
And keep going, I don't take shit from no one

I'm a criminal
'Cause every time I write a rhyme

But I don't gotta say a word
I just flip 'em the bird
And keep going, I don't take shit from no one

My mother did drugs, hard liquor, cigarettes, and speed
The baby came out disfigured, ligaments indeed
It was a seed who would grow up just as crazy as she
Don't dare make fun of that baby 'cause that baby was me

I'm a criminal, an animal caged who turned crazed
But how the fuck you supposed to grow up when you weren't raised?
So as I got older and I got a lot taller
My dick shrunk smaller, but my balls got larger

I drink more liquor
To fuck you up quicker
Than you'd wanna fuck me up for saying the word
My morals went ... when the president got oral
Sex in his Oval Office on top of his desk
Off of his own employee

Now don't ignore me
You won't avoid me
You can't miss me, I'm white, blonde-haired
And my nose is pointy
I'm the bad guy who makes fun of people that die
In plane crashes and laughs
As long as it ain't happened to him

Slim Shady, I'm as crazy as Eminem and Kim combined
"The Maniac's in" in place of the doctor
'Cause Dre couldn't make it today
He's a little under the weather
So I'm taking his place

Oh, that's Dre with an AK to his face
Don't make me kill him too and spray his brains all over the place
I told you Dre, you should've kept that thang put away
I guess that'll teach you not to let me play with it, eh?
I'm a criminal

Aight look (uh huh) just go up in that motherfucker
Get the motherfucking money and get the fuck up outta there
Aight
I'll be right here waiting on you
Aight
Yo Em
What?!
Don't kill nobody this time
Awwright. Goddamn, this motherfucker gets on my fucking nerves
Aha?
How you doin'?
Hi, how can I help you?
Yeah I need to make a withdrawal
Okay
Put the fucking money in the bag bitch and I won't kill you!
What? Oh my God, don't kill me
I'm not gonna kill you bitch, quit looking around
Don't kill me, I've got two kids at home don't kill me, don't kill me
I said I'm not gonna fucking kill you
Hurry the fuck up! Thank you!
Go, go, go!

Windows tinted on my ride when I drive in it
So when I rob a bank, run out and just dive in it
So I'll be disguised in it
And if anybody identifies the guy in it
I'll hide for five minutes

Come back, shoot the eyewitness
Fire at the private eye hired to pry in my business
Die, bitches, bastards, brats, pets
This puppy's lucky I didn't blast his ass yet

If I ever gave a fuck, I'd shave my nuts
Tuck my dick in between my legs and cluck
You motherfucking chickens ain't brave enough
To say the stuff I say, so just tape it shut

Shit, half the shit I say, I just make it up
To make you mad so kiss my white naked ass
And if it's not a rapper that I make it as
I'mma be a fucking rapist in a Jason mask

I'm a criminal
'Cause every time I write a rhyme
These people think it's a crime
To tell 'em what's on my mind
I guess I'm a criminal
But I don't gotta say a word
I just flip 'em the bird

And everyone should get along
Okay, children, quiet down, quiet down
Children, I'd like to introduce our new substitute teacher for the day: his name is Mr. Shady
Children, quiet down please
Brian, don't throw that! (Shut up!)
Mr. Shady will be your new substitute while Mr. Kaniff is out with pneumonia (He's got AIDS!)
Good luck, Mr. Shady!

Hi there, little boys and girls! (Fuck you!)
Today we're gonna learn how to poison squirrels
But first, I'd like you to meet my friend Bob (Huh?)
Say hi, Bob ("Hi, Bob!")
Bob's thirty and still lives with his mom
And he don't got a job 'cause Bob sits at home and smokes pot
But his twelve-year-old brother looks up to him an awful lot
And Bob likes to hang out at the local waffle spot
And wait in the parking lot for waitresses off the clock
When it's late and the lot gets dark and fake like he walks his dog
Drag 'em in the woods and go straight to the chopping blocks (Ahh!)
And even if they escaped and they got the cops
The ladies would all be so afraid, they would drop the charge
'Til one night Mrs. Stacey went off the job
When she felt someone grab her whole face and said not to talk
But Stacey knew it was Bob and said, "Knock it off!"
But Bob wouldn't knock it off, 'cause he's crazy and off his rocker
Crazier than Slim Shady is off the vodka
You couldn't even take him to Dre's to get Bob a doctor
He grabbed Stace' by the legs as he chopped it off her
And dropped her off in the lake for the cops to find her
But ever since the day Stacey went off to wander
They never found her, and Bob still hangs at the waffle diner
And that's the story of Bob and his marijuana
And what it might do to you
So see if the squirrels want it—it's bad for you

See, children, drugs are bad (Come on)
And if you don't believe me, ask your dad (Ask him, man)
And if you don't believe him, ask your mom (That's right)
She'll tell you how she does 'em all the time (She will)
So kids, say no to drugs (That's right)
So you don't act like everyone else does (Uh-huh)
And there's really nothin' else to say (Sing along)
Drugs are just bad, mmkay?

My penis is the size of a peanut, have you seen it?
Fuck, no! You ain't seen it! It's the size of a peanut (Huh?)
Speakin' of peanuts, you know what else is bad for squirrels?
Ecstasy—it's the worst drug in the world
If someone ever offers it to you, don't do it
Kids, two hits'll probably drain all your spinal fluid
And spinal fluid is final, you won't get it back
So don't get attached, or it'll attack every bone in your back
Meet Zach: twenty-one years old
After hangin' out with some friends at a frat party, he gets bold
And decides to try five when he's bribed by five guys
And the peer pressure will win every time you try to fight it
Suddenly, he starts to convulse
And his pulse goes into hyperdrive
And his eyes roll back in his skull (Blblblblblb)
His back starts to look like the McDonald's Arches
He's on Donald's carpet, layin' horizontal, barfin' (Bleh)
And everyone in the apartment starts laughin' at him
"Hey Adam, Zach is a jackass, look at him!"
'Cause they took it too, so they think it's funny
So they're laughing at basically nothing
Except maybe wasting their money
Meanwhile, Zach's in a coma, the action is over
And his back and his shoulders hunched up like he's practicin' yoga
And that's the story of Zach, the ecstasy maniac
So don't even feed that to squirrels, class, 'cause it's bad for you

See, children, drugs are bad (That's right)
And if you don't believe me, ask your dad (That's right)
And if you don't believe him, ask your mom (You can)
She'll tell you how she does 'em all the time (She will)
So kids, say no to drugs (Don't smoke crack)
So you don't act like everyone else does (That's right)
And there's really nothin' else to say (But umm…)
Drugs are just bad, mmkay?

And last but not least, one of the most humongous
Problems among young people today is fungus
It grows from cow manure; they pick it out, wipe it off, bag it up
And you put it right in your mouth and chew it
Yum-yum! Then you start to see some dumb stuff
And everything slows down when you eat some of 'em
And sometimes, you see things that aren't there (Like what?)
Like fat women in G-strings with orange hair
(Mr. Shady, what's a G-string?) It's yarn, Claire
Women stick 'em up their behinds, go out and wear 'em (Huh?)
And if you swallow too much of the magic mushrooms
Whoops, did I say 'magic mushrooms?' I meant fungus
Your tongue gets all swoll up like a cow's tongue
(How come?) 'Cause it comes from a cow's dung (Gross!)
See, drugs are bad, it's a common fact
But your mom and dad know that's all that I'm good at (Oh!)
But don't be me, 'cause if you grow up and you go and OD
They're gonna come for me, and I'ma have to grow a goatee
And get a disguise and hide, 'cause it'll be my fault
So don't do drugs, and do exactly as I don't, 'cause I'm bad for you

See, children, drugs are bad (Uh-huh)
And if you don't believe me, ask your dad (Put that down!)
And if you don't believe him, ask your mom (You can ask)
She'll tell you how she does 'em all the time (And she will)
So kids, say no to drugs (Say no)
So you don't act like everyone else does (Like I do)
And there's really nothin' else to say (That's right)
Drugs are just bad, mmkay?

Come on, children, clap along! (Shut up!)
Sing along, children! (Suck my motherfuckin' dick!)
Come on, clap along
Drugs are just bad, drugs are just bad (South Park is gonna sue me!)
So don't do drugs! (Kiss my motherfuckin' ass!)
So there'll be more for me (Hippie! Goddamn it!)
(Mushrooms killed Kenny!)
(Uh, the fart button's on) [*fart*] (Ew, ahh!)
La la la (So fucked up right now)

America, we love you
How many people are proud to be citizens of this beautiful country of ours
The stripes and the stars for the rights that men have died for to protect the women and men who have broke their necks for the freedom of speech the United States Government has sworn to uphold
(Yo', I want everybody to listen to the words of this song) or so we're told

I never would've dreamed in a million years I'd see
So many motherfuckin' people who feel like me
Who share the same views and the same exact beliefs
It's like a fuckin' army marchin' in back of me

So many lives I touched, so much anger aimed
In no particular direction, just sprays and sprays
And straight through your radio waves it plays and plays
'Til it stays stuck in your head for days and days

Who would've thought, standing in this mirror bleachin' my hair
With some peroxide reaching for a T-shirt to wear
That I would catapult to the forefront of rap like this?
How could I predict my words would have an impact like this?

I must've struck a chord, with somebody up in the office
Cause Congress keeps telling me I ain't causin' nothin' but problems
And now they're sayin' I'm in trouble with the government
I'm lovin' it
I shoveled shit all my life
And now I'm dumping it on

White America, I could be one of your kids
White America, little Eric looks just like this
White America, Erica loves my shit
I go to TRL, look how many hugs I get
White America, I could be one of your kids
White America, little Eric looks just like this
White America, Erica loves my shit
I go to TRL, look how many hugs I get

Look at these eyes, baby blue, baby just like yourself
If they were brown, Shady lose, Shady sits on the shelf
But Shady's cute, Shady knew, Shady's dimples would help
Make ladies swoon, baby—ooh, baby!—look at my sales

Let's do the math, if I was black, I would've sold half, I
Ain't have to graduate from Lincoln High School to know that
But I could rap, so fuck school, I'm too cool to go back
Gimme the mic, show me where the fuckin' studio's at

When I was underground, no one gave a fuck I was white
No labels wanted to sign me, almost gave up, I was like
"Fuck it!" until I met Dre, the only one to look past
Gave me a chance, and I lit a fire up under his ass

Helped him get back to the top, every fan black that I got
Was probably his in exchange for every white fan that he's got
Like damn, we just swapped, sittin' back lookin' at shit, wow
I'm like my skin is just starting to work to my benefit now
It's

White America, I could be one of your kids
White America, little Eric looks just like this
White America, Erica loves my shit
I go to TRL, look how many hugs I get
White America, I could be one of your kids
White America, little Eric looks just like this
White America, Erica loves my shit
I go to TRL, look how many hugs I get

See the problem is I speak to suburban kids
Who otherwise would've never knew these words exist
Whose moms probably would've never gave two squirts of piss
'Til I created so much motherfuckin' turbulence

Straight out the tube right into your living rooms I came
And kids flipped when they knew I was produced by Dre
That's all it took, and they were instantly hooked right in
And they connected with me too because I looked like them

That's why they put my lyrics up under this microscope
Searchin' with a fine tooth comb, it's like this rope
Waitin' to choke
Tightening around my throat
Watching me while I write this
Like I don't like this
Nope

All I hear is lyrics, lyrics, constant controversy
Sponsors working 'round the clock to try to stop my concerts early
Surely hip-hop was never a problem
In Harlem
Only in Boston
After it bothered the fathers of daughters starting to blossom

So now I'm catchin' the flak
From these activists when they raggin'
Actin' like I'm the first rapper
To smack a bitch, or say "faggot"

Shit, just look at me like I'm your closest pal
The posterchild
The motherfuckin' spokesman now for

White America, I could be one of your kids
White America, little Eric looks just like this
White America, Erica loves my shit
I go to TRL, look how many hugs I get
White America, I could be one of your kids
White America, little Eric looks just like this
White America, Erica loves my shit
I go to TRL, look how many hugs I get

So to the parents of America
I am the Derringer aimed at little Erica
To attack her character
The ringleader of this circus of worthless pawns
Sent to lead the march right up to the steps of congress
And piss on the lawns of the White House
To burn the flag and replace it with a Parental Advisory sticker
To spit liquor
In the faces of in this democracy of hypocrisy

Fuck you, Ms. Cheney
Fuck you, Tipper Gore
Fuck you with the freest of speech this Divided States of Embarrassment will allow me to have
Fuck you

I'm just playin', America, you know, I love you

Marshall! Sounds like an SOS
Holy wack unlyrical lyrics, Andre, you're fucking right!
To the Rapmobile – let's go!
(Marshall! Marshall!)
Bitches and gentlemen! It's showtime!
Hurry hurry, step right up!
Introducing the star of our show
His name is (Marshall!)
You wouldn't want to be
Anywhere else in the world right now
So without further ado, I bring to you (Marshall!)

You 'bout to witness hip-hop in its most purest
Most rawest form, flow almost flawless
Most hardest, most honest known artist
Chip off the old block, but old Doc is (back)
Looks like Batman brought his own Robin
Oh God, Saddam's got his own Laden
With his own private plane, his own pilot
Set to blow college dorm room doors off the hinges
Oranges, peach, pears, plums, syringes
Vrinn, vrinn! Yeah, here I come, I'm inches
Away from you, dear, fear none
Hip-hop is in a state of 9-1-1, so

Let's get down to business
I don't got no time to play around, what is this?
Must be a circus in town, let's shut the shit down
On these clowns; can I get a witness? (Hell yeah!)
Let's get down to business
I don't got no time to play around, what is this?
Must be a circus in town, let's shut the shit down
On these clowns; can I get a witness? (Hell yeah!)

Quick, gotta move fast, gotta perform miracles
Gee willikers Dre, "Holy bat syllables!"
Look at all the bullshit that goes on
In Gotham when I'm gone
Time to get rid of these rap criminals
So skip to your lou while I do what I do best
You ain't even impressed no more, you're used to it
Flow's too wet, nobody close to it
Nobody says it but still everybody knows the shit
The most hated on out of all those who say
They get hated on in eighty songs and exaggerate it all so much
They make it all up, there's no such thing
Like a female with good looks who cooks and cleans
It just means so much more to so much more
People when you're rappin' and you know what for
The show must go on; so I'd like to welcome y'all
To Marshall and Andre's carnival, c'mon!

Now let's get down to business
I don't got no time to play around, what is this?
Must be a circus in town, let's shut the shit down
On these clowns; can I get a witness? (Hell yeah!)
Let's get down to business
I don't got no time to play around, what is this?
Must be a circus in town, let's shut the shit down
On these clowns; can I get a witness? (Hell yeah!)

It's just like old times, the Dynamic Duo
Two old friends, why panic? You already know
Who's fully capable, the two caped heroes
Dial straight down the center, eight-zero-zero
You can even call collect, the most feared duet
Since me and Elton played career Russian Roulette
And never even see me blink or get to bustin' a sweat
People steppin' over people just to rush to the set
Just to get to see an MC who breathes so freely
Ease over these beats and be so breezy
Jesus, how can shit be so easy?
How can one Chandra be so Levy?
Turn on these beats, MCs don't see me
Believe me, BET and MTV
Are gonna grieve when we leave, dog, fo' sheezy
Can't leave rap alone, the game needs me
'Til we grow beards, get weird and disappear
Into the mountains, nothin' but clowns down here
But we ain't fuckin' around 'round here
Yo, Dre (What up?) Can I get a "hell yeah"? (Hell yeah!)

Now let's get down to business
I don't got no time to play around, what is this?
Must be a circus in town, let's shut the shit down
On these clowns; can I get a witness? (Hell yeah!)
Let's get down to business
I don't got no time to play around, what is this?
Must be a circus in town, let's shut the shit down
On these clowns; can I get a witness? (Hell yeah!)

So there you have it, folks
(Marshall!) has come to save the day
Back with his friend Andre
Here to remind you that bullshit does not pay
Because (Marshall!) and Andre are here to stay
And never go away, until our dying day
Until we're old and grey (Marshall!)
So until next time, friends
Same blonde hair, same rap channel
Good night, everyone! Thank you for coming!
Your host for the evening (Marshall!)
Oh! Heh

Where's my snare?
I have no snare in my headphones. There you go
Yeah... yo, yo

Have you ever been hated or discriminated against?
I have; I've been protested and demonstrated against
Picket signs for my wicked rhymes, look at the times
Sick as the mind of the motherfucking kid that's behind
All this commotion emotions run deep as oceans, exploding
Tempers flaring from parents just blow 'em off and keep going
Not taking nothing from no one give 'em hell long as I'm breathing
Keep kicking ass in the morning and taking names in the evening
Leave 'em with a taste as sour as vinegar in they mouth
See they can trigger me, but they'll never figure me out
Look at me now; I bet you're probably sick of me now ain't you mama?
I'mma make you look so ridiculous now

I'm sorry mama!
I never meant to hurt you!
I never meant to make you cry; but tonight
I'm cleaning out my closet (one more time)
I said I'm sorry mama!
I never meant to hurt you!
I never meant to make you cry, but tonight
I'm cleaning out my closet

Ha! I got some skeletons in my closet
And I don't know if no one knows it
So before they throw me inside my coffin and close it
I'mma expose it; I'll take you back to '73
Before I ever had a multi-platinum-selling CD
I was a baby, maybe I was just a couple of months
My faggot father must have had his panties up in a bunch
'Cause he split, I wonder if he even kissed me goodbye
No I don't. On second thought I just fucking wished he would die
I look at Hailie, and I couldn't picture leaving her side
Even if I hated Kim, I'd grit my teeth and I'd try
To make it work with her at least for Hailie's sake
I maybe made some mistakes
But I'm only human, but I'm man enough to face them today
What I did was stupid, no doubt it was dumb
But the smartest shit I did was take them bullets outta that gun
'Cause I'da killed him; shit I would've shot Kim and him both
It's my life, I'd like to welcome y'all to "The Eminem Show"

I'm sorry mama!
I never meant to hurt you!
I never meant to make you cry; but tonight
I'm cleaning out my closet (one more time)
I said I'm sorry mama!
I never meant to hurt you!
I never meant to make you cry, but tonight
I'm cleaning out my closet

Now I would never diss my own mama just to get recognition
Take a second to listen 'fore you think this record is dissing
But put yourself in my position; just try to envision
Witnessing your mama popping prescription pills in the kitchen
Bitching that someone's always going through her purse and shit's missing
Going through public housing systems, victim of Münchausen's Syndrome
My whole life I was made to believe I was sick when I wasn't
'Til I grew up, now I blew up, it makes you sick to your stomach
Doesn't it? Wasn't it the reason you made that CD for me Ma?
So you could try to justify the way you treated me Ma?
But guess what? You're getting older now and it's cold when you're lonely
And Nathan's growing up so quick he's gonna know that you're phony
And Hailie's getting so big now; you should see her, she's beautiful
But you'll never see her, she won't even be at your funeral!
See what hurts me the most is you won't admit you was wrong
Bitch do your song, keep telling yourself that you was a mom!
But how dare you try to take what you didn't help me to get
You selfish bitch; I hope you fucking burn in hell for this shit
Remember when Ronnie died and you said you wished it was me?
Well guess what, I am dead, dead to you as can be!

I'm sorry mama!
I never meant to hurt you!
I never meant to make you cry; but tonight
I'm cleaning out my closet (one more time)
I said I'm sorry mama!
I never meant to hurt you!
I never meant to make you cry, but tonight
I'm cleaning out my closet

I'm sorry mama!
I never meant to hurt you!
I never meant to make you cry; but tonight
I'm cleaning out my closet (one more time)
I said I'm sorry mama!
I never meant to hurt you!
I never meant to make you cry, but tonight
I'm cleaning out my closet

People! It feels so good to be back
Ladies and gentleman, introducing the new and improved you know who

Never been the type to bend or budge
The wrong button to push
No friend of Bush
I'm the centerpiece, you're a Maltese
I'm a pitbull off his leash
All this peace talk can cease
All these people I had to leave in limbo
I'm back now
I've come to release this info
I'll be brief and let me just keep shit simple
Can-I-Bitch don't want no beef with Slim?
No!
Not even on my radar
So won't you please jump off my dick
Lay off and stay off
And follow me as I put these crayons to chaos from seance to seance
Aw-a-aw-ch-a-aw

You all c'mon now
Let's all get on down
Let's do-si-do now
We're gon' have a good old time
Don't be scared, 'cause there ain't nothing to worry about
Let your hair down
And square dance with me!

Let your hair down to the track
Yeah kick on back
Boo!
The boogie monster of rap
Yeah the man's back
With a plan to ambush this Bush administration
Mush the Senate's face and push this generation
Of kids to stand and fight for the right to say something you might not like
This white hot light
That I'm under
No wonder
I look so sunburnt
Oh no
I won't leave no stone unturned
Oh no I won't leave
Won't go nowhere
Do-si-do
Oh, yo, ho, hello there
Oh yeah don't think I won't go there
Go to Beirut and do a show there
Yeah you laugh 'til your motherfuckin' ass gets drafted
While you're at band camp thinkin' that crap can't happen
Till you fuck around
Get an anthrax napkin
Inside a package wrapped in saran Wrap wrapping
Open the plastic and then you stand back gasping
Fuckin' assassins hi-jackin' Amtraks crashing
All this terror America demands action
Next thing you know you've got Uncle Sam's ass askin'
To join the army or what you'll do for their Navy
You just a baby
Gettin' recruited at eighteen
You're on a plane now
Eating their food and their baked beans
I'm 28
They gonna take you 'fore they take me
Crazy insane or insane crazy?
When I say Hussein you say Shady
My views ain't changed still Inhumane
Wait
Arraigned two days late
The date's today
Hang me!

You all c'mon now
Let's all get on down
Let's do-si-do now
We're gon' have a good old time
Don't be scared, 'cause there ain't nothing to worry about
Let your hair down
And square dance with me!

You all c'mon now
Let's all get on down
Let's do-si-do now
We're gon' have a good old time
Don't be scared, 'cause there ain't nothing to worry about
Let your hair down
And square dance with me!

Nothin' moves me more than a groove that soothes me
Nothin' soothes me more than a groove
that boosts me
Nothin' boosts me more
Or suits me beautifully
There's nothin' you can do to me
Stab me
Shoot me
Psychotic
Hypnotic, product I got the antibiotic
Ain't nobody hotter and so on and yada yada
God I talk a lot of hem-de-lay-la-la-la
oochie walla walla um da dah da dah da but you gotta gotta
Keep movin'
There's more music to make
Keep makin' new shit
Produce hits to break
the monotony
What's gotten into me?
Drugs, rock and Hennessy
Thug like I'm 'Pac on my enemies
On your knees
Got you under siege
Somebody you would give a lung to be hungry
Like a fuckin' younger me
Fuck the fee
I can get you jumped for free
Yeah buddy
Laugh it's funny
I have the money to have you killed by somebody who has nothing
I'm past bluffing
Pass the K-Y
Let's get ready for some intense
serious ass fucking!

You all c'mon now
Let's all get on down
Let's do-si-do now
We're gon' have a good old time
Don't be scared, 'cause there ain't nothing to worry about
Let your hair down
And square dance with me!

You all c'mon now
Let's all get on down
Let's do-si-do now
We're gon' have a good old time
Don't be scared, 'cause there ain't nothing to worry about
Let your hair down
And square dance with me!

Dr. Dre. wants to square dance with me
Nasty Nas wants to square dance with me
X to the Z wants to square dance with me
Busta Rhymes wants to square dance with me
Can-I-Bitch won't square dance with me
Fan-a-bitch, won't square dance with me
Canada-bis, don't want no parts of me
Dirty Dozen wants to square dance with you

I'm a soldier, I'm a soldier, I'm a soldier, I'm a soldier

Yo', never was a thug, just infatuated with guns
Never was a gangster, 'til I graduated to one
And got the rep of a villain
For weapon concealin'
Took the image of a thug, kept shit appealin'

Willin' to stick out my neck
For respect
If it meant life or death
Never live to regret what I said
When you're me
People just want to see
If it's true, if it's you, what you say in your raps, what you do
So they feel
it's part of your obligation to fulfill
When they see you on the streets, face to face, are you for real
In confrontation
Ain't no conversation
If you feel you're in violation
Any hesitation'll get you killed, if you feel it, kill it
If you conceal it, reveal it
Being reasonable will leave you full of bullets
Pull it, squeeze it, 'til it's empty
Tempt me, push me, pussies
I need a good reason to give this trigger a good squeeze

I'm a soldier, these shoulders hold up so much
They won't budge
I'll never fall or fold up
I'm a soldier
Even if my collar bones crush or crumble
I will never slip or stumble
I'm a soldier
These shoulders hold up so much
They won't budge
I'll never fall or fold up
I'm a soldier
Even if my collar bones crush or crumble
I will never stumble

I love pissin' you off
It gets me off
Like my lawyers, when the fuckin' judge lets me off
All you motherfuckers gotta do is set me off
I'll violate and all the motherfuckin' bets be off
I'm a lit fuse
Anything I do bitch, it's news
Pistol-whippin' motherfuckin' bouncer 6'2"
Who needs bullets
as soon as I pull it, you sweat bullets
An excellent method to get rid of the next bully
It's actually better 'cause instead of you murderin'
You can hurt 'em
And come back again and kick dirt at 'em
It's like pourin' salt in the wounds
Assault and get sued
You can smell the lawsuits soon as I waltz in the room
Everybody halts and stops, and calls the cops
All you see is bitches comin' out their halter tops
Runnin' and duckin' out the Hot Rocks parking lot
You'll all get shot whether it's your fault or not, 'cause

I'm a soldier, these shoulders hold up so much
They won't budge
I'll never fall or fold up
I'm a soldier
Even if my collar bones crush or crumble
I will never slip or stumble
I'm a soldier
These shoulders hold up so much
They won't budge
I'll never fall or fold up
I'm a soldier
Even if my collar bones crush or crumble
I will never stumble

I spit it slow so these kids know that I'm talkin' to 'em
Give it back to these damn critics and sock it to 'em
I'm like a thug, with a little bit of Pac influence
I spew it, and look how I got you bitches rockin' to it
You motherfuckers could never do it like I could do it
Don't even try it, you'll look stupid, do not pursue it
Don't ever in your life, try to knock the truest
I spit the illest shit, ever been dropped in two-inch
So ticky-tock listen as the sound ticks on the clock
Listen to the sound of Kim as she licks on a cock
Listen to the sound of me spillin' my heart through this pen
Motherfuckers know that I'll never be Marshall again
Full of controversy
Until I retire my jersey
'Til the fire inside dies and expires at thirty
And Lord have mercy on any more of these rappers that verse me
And put a curse on authorities in the face of adversity, I'm a

I'm a soldier, these shoulders hold up so much
They won't budge
I'll never fall or fold up
I'm a soldier
Even if my collar bones crush or crumble
I will never slip or stumble
I'm a soldier
These shoulders hold up so much
They won't budge
I'll never fall or fold up
I'm a soldier
Even if my collar bones crush or crumble
I will never stumble

Yo' left, yo' left, yo' left, right, left
Yo' left, yo' left, yo' left, right, left
Yo' left, yo' left, yo' left, right, left
Yo' left, yo' left, yo' left, right, left

Sayin' goodbye, sayin' goodbye to Hollywood
Sayin' goodbye, sayin' goodbye to Hollywood
Sayin' goodbye, sayin' goodbye to Hollywood
Sayin' goodbye, sayin' goodbye to Hollywood

Sayin' goodbye, sayin' goodbye to Hollywood
(Why do I feel this way)
Sayin' goodbye, sayin' goodbye to Hollywood
Sayin' goodbye, sayin' goodbye to Hollywood
Sayin' goodbye, sayin' goodbye to Hollywood

I thought I had it all figured out, I did
I thought I was tough enough to stick it out with Kim
But I wasn't tough enough to juggle two things at once
I found myself layin' on my knees in cuffs
Which should've been a reason enough, for me to get my stuff and just leave
How come I couldn't see this shit myself, it's just me
Nobody couldn't see the shit I felt
Knowin' damn well she wasn't gonna be there when I fell, to catch me
The minute shit was heated she just bailed
I'm standin' here swingin' on like thirty people by myself
I couldn't even see the millimeter when it fell
Turned around saw Gary stashin' the heater in his belt
Saw the bouncers rush him and beat him to the ground
I just sold two million records, I don't need to go to jail
I'm not about to lose my freedom over no female
I need to slow down
Try to get my feet on solid ground, so for now I'm

Sayin' goodbye, sayin' goodbye to Hollywood
Sayin' goodbye, sayin' goodbye to Hollywood
Sayin' goodbye, sayin' goodbye to Hollywood
Sayin' goodbye, sayin' goodbye to Hollywood

Sayin' goodbye, sayin' goodbye to Hollywood
Sayin' goodbye, sayin' goodbye to Hollywood
Sayin' goodbye, sayin' goodbye to Hollywood

Bury my face in comic books, 'cause I don't wanna look
At nothin', this world's too much
I've swallowed all I could
If I could swallow a bottle of Tylenol I would, and end it for good
Just say goodbye to Hollywood
I probably should, these problems are piling all at once
'Cause everything that bothers me, I got it bottled up
I think I'm bottomin' out
But I'm not about to give up, I gotta get up
Thank God, I got a little girl
And I'm a responsible father
So not a lot of good, I'd be to my daughter layin' in the bottom of the mud
Must be in my blood 'cause I don't know how I do it
All I know is I don't wanna follow in the footsteps of my dad
'Cause I hate him so bad
The worst fear that I had was growin' up to be like his fuckin' ass, man
If you could understand why I am the way that I am
What do I say to my fans, when I tell 'em I'm

Sayin' goodbye, sayin' goodbye to Hollywood
Sayin' goodbye, sayin' goodbye to Hollywood
Sayin' goodbye, sayin' goodbye to Hollywood
Sayin' goodbye, sayin' goodbye to Hollywood

Sayin' goodbye, sayin' goodbye to Hollywood
(Why do I feel this way)
Sayin' goodbye, sayin' goodbye to Hollywood
Sayin' goodbye, sayin' goodbye to Hollywood
Sayin' goodbye, sayin' goodbye to Hollywood

I don't wanna quit, but shit, I feel like this is it
For me to have this much appeal like this is sick
This is not a game, this fame, in real life this is sick
Publicity stunt my ass, conceal my fuckin' dick
Fuck the guns, I'm done, I'll never look at gats
If I scrap, I'll scrap like I ain't never whipped some ass
I love my fans
But no one ever puts a grasp on the fact I've sacrificed everything I have
I never dreamt I'd get to the level that I'm at, this is whack
This is more than I ever could of asked
Everywhere I go, a hat, a sweater hood, or mask
What about math, how come I wasn't ever good at that
It's like the boy in the bubble, who never could adapt, I'm trapped
If I could go back, I never woulda rapped
I sold my soul to the devil, I'll never get it back
I just wanna leave this game with level head intact
Imagine goin' from bein' a no one to seein'
Everything blow up and all you did was just grow up emceeing
It's fuckin' crazy
'Cause all I wanted was to give Hailie the life I never had
But instead I forced us to live alienated, so I'm sayin'

Sayin' goodbye, sayin' goodbye to Hollywood
Sayin' goodbye, sayin' goodbye to Hollywood
Sayin' goodbye, sayin' goodbye to Hollywood
Sayin' goodbye, sayin' goodbye to Hollywood

Sayin' goodbye, sayin' goodbye to Hollywood
Sayin' goodbye, sayin' goodbye to Hollywood
Sayin' goodbye, sayin' goodbye to Hollywood

Goodbye, goodbye Hollywood
(Goodbye)
Please don't cry for me, when I'm gone for good
(This shit is not for me)
So goodbye, goodbye Hollywood
(I'm not a fuckin' star)
Please don't cry for me, when I'm gone for good
(I'm goin' back home)

Two trailer-park girls go 'round the outside, 'round the outside, 'round the outside
Two trailer-park girls go 'round the outside, 'round the outside, 'round the outside

Guess who's back, back again
Shady's back, tell a friend
Guess who's back
Guess who's back
Guess who's back
Guess who's back
Guess who's back
Guess who's back
Guess who's back

I've created a monster
'Cause nobody wants to see Marshall no more
They want Shady I'm chopped liver
Well if you want Shady, this is what I'll give ya
A little bit of weed mixed with some hard liquor
Some vodka that'll jump-start my heart
Quicker than a shock
When I get shocked at the hospital by the doctor
When I'm not cooperating
When I'm rocking the table while he's operating (hey!)

You waited this long now stop debating
'Cause I'm back I'm on the rag and ovulating
I know that you got a job Ms. Cheney
But your husband's heart problem's complicating

So the FCC won't let me be
Or let me be me so let me see
They try to shut me down on MTV
But it feels so empty without me

So come on dip, bum on your lips fuck that
Cum on your lips and some on your tits and get ready 'cause this shit's about to get heavy
I just settled all my lawsuits
Fuck you, Debbie!

Now this looks like a job for me so everybody just follow me
'Cause we need a little controversy
'Cause it feels so empty without me

I said this looks like a job for me so everybody just follow me
'Cause we need a little controversy
'Cause it feels so empty without me

Little hellions kids feeling rebellious
Embarrassed, their parents still listen to Elvis
They start feeling like prisoners, helpless
'Til someone comes along on a mission and yells "bitch"

A visionary, vision is scary
Could start a revolution
Polluting the air waves a rebel
So just let me revel and bask
In the fact that I got everyone kissing my ass
And it's a disaster
Such a catastrophe for you to see so damn much of my ass
You ask for me?

Well I'm back
Fix your bent antennae
Tune it in and then I'm gonna enter in
And up under your skin like a splinter
The center of attention back for the winter

I'm interesting, the best thing since wrestling
Infesting in your kid's ears and nesting
Testing attention please
Feel the tension soon as someone mentions me
Here's my 10 cents my 2 cents is free
A nuisance, who sent, you sent for me?

Now this looks like a job for me so everybody just follow me
'Cause we need a little controversy
'Cause it feels so empty without me

I said this looks like a job for me so everybody just follow me
'Cause we need a little controversy
'Cause it feels so empty without me

A tisk-it a task-it
I'll go tit for tat with anybody who's talking this shit, that shit
Chris Kirkpatrick you can get your ass kicked
Worse than them little Limp Bizkit bastards

And Moby
You can get stomped by Obie
You 36 year old bald-headed fag blow me
You don't know me
You're too old
Let go
It's over, nobody listens to techno

Now let's go, just give me the signal
I'll be there with a whole list full of new insults
I've been dope, suspenseful with a pencil
Ever since Prince turned himself into a symbol

But sometimes the shit just seems
Everybody only wants to discuss me
So this must mean I'm disgusting
But it's just me I'm just obscene

No, I'm not the first king of controversy
I am the worst thing since Elvis Presley
To do black music so selfishly
And use it to get myself wealthy (Hey)

There's a concept that works
20 million other white rappers emerge
But no matter how many fish in the sea
It'd be so empty without me

Now this looks like a job for me so everybody just follow me
'Cause we need a little controversy
'Cause it feels so empty without me

I said this looks like a job for me so everybody just follow me

Kids

These ideas are nightmares to white parents
Whose worst fear is a child with dyed hair and who likes earrings
Like whatever they say has no bearing
It's so scary in a house that allows no swearing
To see him walkin' around with his headphones blarin'
Alone in his own zone, cold and he don't care, he's
A problem child, and what bothers him all comes out
When he talks about his fuckin' dad walkin' out (Bitch!)
'Cause he hates him so bad that he blocks him out
If he ever saw him again he'd probably knock him out
His thoughts are wacked, he's mad so he's talkin' back
Talkin' black, brainwashed from rock and rap
He sags his pants, do-rags and a stockin' cap
His step-father hit him so he socked him back
And broke his nose, his house is a broken home
There's no control, he just lets his emotions go

(Come on!) Sing with me (Sing!), sing for the year (Sing it!)
Sing for the laughter and sing for the tear (Come on!)
Sing it with me, it's just for today
Maybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you away

Entertainment is changin', intertwinin' with gangsters
In the land of the killers, a sinner's mind is a sanctum
Holy or unholy, only have one homie
Only this gun, lonely 'cause don't anyone know me
Yet everybody just feels like they can relate (Huh-uh)
I guess words are a motherfucker, they can be great
Or they can degrade, or even worse, they can teach hate
It's like these kids hang on every single statement we make
Like they worship us, plus all the stores ship us platinum
Now how the fuck did this metamorphosis happen?
From standin' on corners and porches just rappin'
To havin' a fortune, no more kissin' ass
But then these critics crucify you (Yep), journalists try to burn you
Fans turn on you, attorneys all want a turn at you
To get their hands on every dime you have
They want you to lose your mind every time you mad
So they can try to make you out to look like a loose cannon
Any dispute won't hesitate to produce handguns
That's why these prosecutors wanna convict me
Strictly just to get me off of these streets quickly
But all their kids be listenin' to me religiously
So I'm signin' CDs while police fingerprint me
They're for the judge's daughter, but his grudge is against me
If I'm such a fuckin' menace, this shit doesn't make sense, B
It's all political, if my music is literal
And I'm a criminal, how the fuck can I raise a little girl?
I couldn't, I wouldn't be fit to
You're full of shit too, Guerrera, that was a fist that hit you! (Bitch!)

(Come on!) Sing with me (Sing!), sing for the year (Sing it!)
Sing for the laughter and sing for the tear (Sing that shit!)
Sing it with me, it's just for today
Maybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you away

They say music can alter moods and talk to you
Well, can it load a gun up for you and cock it too?
Well, if it can, then the next time you assault a dude
Just tell the judge it was my fault and I'll get sued
See, what these kids do is hear about us totin' pistols
And they wanna get one 'cause they think the shit's cool
Not knowin' we really just protectin' ourselves
We entertainers, of course the shit's affectin' our sales
You ignoramus, but music is reflection of self
We just explain it, and then we get our checks in the mail
It's fucked up, ain't it? How we can come from practically nothin'
To bein' able to have any fuckin' thing that we wanted
That's why we sing for these kids who don't have a thing
Except for a dream and a fuckin' rap magazine (Ha-ha!)
Who post pin-up pictures on their walls all day long
Idolize their favorite rappers and know all their songs
Or for anyone who's ever been through shit in their lives
So they sit and they cry at night, wishin' they'd die
'Til they throw on a rap record and they sit and they vibe
We're nothin' to you, but we're the fuckin' shit in their eyes
That's why we seize the moment, try to freeze it and own it
Squeeze it and hold it 'cause we consider these minutes golden
And maybe they'll admit it when we're gone, just let our spirits
Live on through our lyrics that you hear in our songs, and we can…

Sing with me (Sing!), sing for the year (Sing it!)
Sing for the laughter and sing for the tear (Come on!)
Sing it with me, it's just for today
Maybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you away

Sing with me (Sing!), sing for the year (Sing it!)
Sing for the laughter and sing for the tear (Come on!)
Sing it with me, it's just for today
Maybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you away

You high, baby?
Yeah
Ya
Talk to me
You want me to tell you something?
Uh-huh
I know what you wanna hear

'Cause I know you want me baby
I think I want you too
"I think I love you baby"
I think I love you too
I'm here to save you girl
Come be in Shady's world
I wanna grow together
Let's let our love unfurl
You know you want me baby
You know I want you too
They call me Superman
I'm here to rescue you
I wanna save you girl
Come be in Shady's world
"Ooh boy you drive me crazy"
Bitch you make me hurl

They call me Superman
Leap tall hoes in a single bound
I'm single now
Got no ring on this finger now
I'd never let another chick bring me down
In a relationship
Save it bitch, babysit
You make me sick
Superman ain't savin' shit
Girl you can jump on Shady's dick
Straight from the hip, cut to the chase
I tell a motherfuckin' slut to her face
Play no games, say no names
Ever since I broke up with what's-her-face
I'm a different man, kiss my ass
Kiss my lips, bitch why ask?
Kiss my dick, get my cash
I'd rather have you whip my ass
Don't put out, I'll put you out
Won't get out, I'll push you out
Puss blew out, poppin' shit
Wouldn't piss on fire to put you out
Am I too nice?
Buy you ice
Bitch if you died, wouldn't buy you life
What you tryin' to be? My new wife?
What you Mariah, fly through twice

But I do know one thing though
Bitches, they come they go
Saturday through Sunday, Monday
Monday through Sunday yo
Maybe I'll love you one day
Maybe we'll someday grow
'Til then just sit your drunk ass on that fuckin' runway ho

'Cause I can't be your Superman
Can't be your Superman
Can't be your Superman
Can't be your Superman
I can't be your Superman
Can't be your Superman
Can't be your Superman
Your Superman, your Superman

Don't get me wrong, I love these hoes
It's no secret, everybody knows
Yeah we fucked, bitch so what?
That's about as far as your buddy goes
We'll be friends, I'll call you again
I'll chase you around every bar you attend
Never know what kinda car I'll be in
We'll see how much you'll be partying then
You don't want that, neither do I
I don't wanna flip when I see you with guys
Too much pride between you and I
Not a jealous man, but females lie
But I guess that's just what sluts do
How could it ever be just us two
I'd never love you enough to trust you
We just met and I just fucked you

But I do know one thing though
Bitches, they come they go
Saturday through Sunday, Monday
Monday through Sunday yo
Maybe I'll love you one day
Maybe we'll someday grow
'Til then just sit your drunk ass on that fuckin' runway ho

'Cause I can't be your Superman
Can't be your Superman
Can't be your Superman
Can't be your Superman
I can't be your Superman
Can't be your Superman
Can't be your Superman
Your Superman, your Superman

'Cause I can't be your Superman
Can't be your Superman
Can't be your Superman
Can't be your Superman
I can't be your Superman
Can't be your Superman
Can't be your Superman
Your Superman, your Superman

'Cause I know you want me baby
I think I want you too
"I think I love you baby"
I think I love you too
I'm here to save you girl
Come be in Shady's world
I wanna grow together
Let's let our love unfurl
You know you want me baby
You know I want you too
They call me Superman
I'm here to rescue you
I wanna save you girl
Come be in Shady's world
"Ooh boy you drive me crazy"
Bitch you make me hurl

First thing you say
"I'm not fazed, I hang around big stars all day
I don't see what the big deal is anyway
You're just plain old Marshall to me"
Ooh yeah girl run that game
"Hailie Jade, I love that name
Love that tattoo, what's that say?"
"Rot in pieces, uh, that's great"
First off you don't know Marshall
At all so don't grow partial
That's ammo for my arsenal
I'll slap you off that bar stool
There goes another lawsuit
Leave hand prints all across you
Good Lordy whoadie
You must be gone off that water bottle
You want what you can't have
Ooh girl that's too damn bad
Don't touch what you can't grab
End up with two backhands
Put anthrax on a Tampax, and slap you 'til you can't stand
Girl you just blew your chance
Don't mean to ruin your plans

But I do know one thing though
Bitches, they come they go
Saturday through Sunday, Monday
Monday through Sunday yo
Maybe I'll love you one day
Maybe we'll someday grow
'Til then just sit your drunk ass on that fuckin' runway ho

'Cause I can't be your Superman
Can't be your Superman
Can't be your Superman
Can't be your Superman
I can't be your Superman
Can't be your Superman
Can't be your Superman
Your Superman, your Superman

'Cause I can't be your Superman
Can't be your Superman
Can't be your Superman
Can't be your Superman
I can't be your Superman
Can't be your Superman
Can't be your Superman
Your Superman, your Superman

'Cause I know you want me baby
I think I want you too
"I think I love you baby"
I think I love you too
I'm here to save you girl
Come be in Shady's world
I wanna grow together
Let's let our love unfurl
You know you want me baby
You know I want you too
They call me Superman
I'm here to rescue you
I wanna save you girl
Come be in Shady's world
"Ooh boy you drive me crazy"
Bitch you make me hurl

'Cause I can't be your Superman
Can't be your Superman
Can't be your Superman
Can't be your Superman
I can't be your Superman
Can't be your Superman
Can't be your Superman
Your Superman, your Superman

'Cause I can't be your Superman
Can't be your Superman

Can't be your Superman
I can't be your Superman
Can't be your Superman
Can't be your Superman
Your Superman, your Superman

Da-da, da-da
Yo, I can't sing, but
I feel like singing
I wanna fuckin' sing
'Cause I'm happy
Yeah, I'm happy
I got my baby back
Yo, check it out

Some days I sit starin' out the window
Watchin' this world pass me by
Sometimes I think there's nothin' to live for
I almost break down and cry
Sometimes I think I'm crazy, I'm crazy, oh, so crazy
Why am I here? Am I just wastin' my time?
But then I see my baby, suddenly I'm not crazy
It all makes sense when I look into her eyes, oh, no

'Cause sometimes (Fuck) it feels like (I was scared) the world's on my shoulders
Everyone's leanin' on me
'Cause sometimes it feels like the world's almost over
But then she comes back to me

My baby girl keeps gettin' older
I watch her grow up with pride
People make jokes 'cause they don't understand me
They just don't see my real side
I act like shit don't faze me, inside it drives me crazy
My insecurities could eat me alive
But then I see my baby, suddenly I'm not crazy
It all makes sense when I look into her eyes, oh, no

'Cause sometimes it feels like the world's on my shoulders
Everyone's leanin' on me
'Cause sometimes it feels like the world's almost over
But then she comes back to me

Man, if I could sing, I'd keep singin' this song to my daughter
If I could hit the notes, I'd blow somethin' as long as my father
To show her how I feel about her, how proud I am that I got her
God, I'm a daddy, I'm so glad that her mom didn't ['want her' backwards]
Now, you probably get this picture from my public persona
That I'm a pistol-packin' drug addict who bags on his momma
But I wanna just take this time out to be perfectly honest
'Cause there's a lot of shit I keep bottled that hurts deep inside of my soul
And just know that I grow colder the older I grow
This boulder on my shoulder gets heavy and harder to hold
And this load is like the weight of the world and I think my neck is breakin'
Should I just give up or try to live up to these expectations?
Now look, I love my daughter more than life in itself
But I got a wife that's determined to make my life livin' hell
But I handle it well, given the circumstances I'm dealt
So many chances, man, it's too bad, coulda had someone else
But the years that I've wasted is nothin' to the tears that I've tasted
So here's what I'm facin': three felonies, six years of probation
I've went to jail for this woman, I've been to bat for this woman
I've taken bats to people's backs, bent over backwards for this woman
Man, I shoulda seen it comin', what'd I stick my penis up in?
Wouldn't have ripped the prenup up if I'da seen what she was fuckin'
But fuck it, it's over, there's no more reason to cry no more
I got my baby, maybe, the only lady that I adore
Hailie! So sayonara, try tomorrow, nice to know ya
Our baby's traveled back to the arms of her rightful owner
And suddenly it seems like my shoulder blades have just shifted
It's like the greatest gift you can get, the weight has been lifted, and—

Now it don't feel like the world's on my shoulders
Everyone's leanin' on me
'Cause my baby knows that her daddy's a soldier
Nothin' can take her from me

Wooo! Told you I can't sing
Oh, well—I tried
Hailie, 'member when I said
If you ever need anything, Daddy would be right there?
Guess what—Daddy's here
And I ain't goin' nowhere, baby
I love you

If I were to die, murdered in cold blood tomorrow
Would you feel sorrow, or show love? Or would it matter?
Could never be the lead-off batter
If there ain't shit for me to feed off, I'm see-saw battlin'
But there's way too much at stake for me to be fake
There's too much on my plate
I done came way too far in this game to turn and walk away
And not say what I got to say
What the fuck you take me for, a joke? You smoking crack?
'Fore I do that, I'd beg Mariah to take me back
I'll get up 'fore I get down
Run myself in the ground, 'fore I put some wack shit out
I'm tryna smack this one out the park: five-thousand mark
Y'all steady tryna drown a shark
Ain't gon' do nothing but piss me off
Lid to the can of whip-ass, just twist me off
See me leap out, pull a piece out
Fuck shooting, I'm just tryna knock his teeth out
Fuck with me now, bitch; let's see you freestyle!
Talk is cheap, motherfucker, if you really feelin' froggish, leap
Yo, Slim, you gon' let him get away with that?
He tried to play you, you can't let him skate with that
Man, I hate this crap, this ain't rap
This is crazy, the way we act when we confuse hip-hop
With real life when the music stops

Heh, so I'm out the game, huh? (Huh, huh)
Yo, Dre, we ridin'?
Whatever (Ha-ha)
Well, I'm wit' ya, homie
Okay, let's handle the small shit

I was born to brew up storms, stir up shit
Kick up dust, cuss 'til I slur up spit
Grew up too quick, went through too much, knew too much shit
Corrupt, and I'ma pour it on like syrup, bitch
Thick and rich, sick and twisted, Mr. Buttersworth
Dre told me to milk this shit for what it's worth
'Til the cow just tilts and tips and stumbles to Earth
And if I fumble a verse, keep goin'
First take I make, mistakes, just keep it
No punches pull, no punches, that's weak shit
Fake shit, if I ever take shit, I'll eat shit
Wasn't for him, wouldn't be shit
Creep with me as we take a little trip down memory lane
Been here longer than anyone in the game
And I ain't got to lie about my age — But what about Jermaine?
Fuck Jermaine! He don't belong speakin' mine
Or Timbaland's name and don't think I don't read
Your little interviews and see what you're sayin'
And I'm a giant, and I ain't gotta move 'til I'm provoked
When I see you, I'ma step on you and not even know it
You midget, mini-me with a bunch of little mini-you's
Runnin' around your backyard swimming pools
Over 80 million records sold
And I ain't have to do it with 10 or 11-year-olds

'Cause what you say is what you say, say what you say
How you say it whenever you sayin' it, just remember
How you said it when you was sprayin' it, so who you playin' with
Huh? (Huh, huh, huh)
'Cause what you say is what you say, say what you say
How you say it whenever you sayin' it, just remember
How you said it when you was sprayin' it, so who you playin' with
Huh? (Huh, huh, huh)

Second verse, it gets worse, it gets no better than this
Amateurs drink veteran piss
From a Dixie cup, if you ever mix me up
Or confuse me with a Canibus or Dre with a Dupri
We'll rub it in, every club you're in, we'll have you blackballed
And make sure you never rap a-fuckin'-gain
Dre ain't havin' it, long as I'm here to play devil's advocate
If there was some magic shit I could wave
Over the industry that could save it when I'm gone
And buried to make sure the tradition carries on, I would
If I could only use this power for good I wouldn't, not even if I could
From the hood, and I'm a hornet
And I'ma only sting when I'm cornered
And I'ma only sucker punch and swing without warning
And swing to knock somebody's fuckin' head off
'Cause I know if they get up, I won't get a chance to let off
Another punch, I'm punk rock, no one's punk
Don't give a fuck: white-Pac, so much spunk
When I was little I knew I would blow up and sell a mil'
Or grow up to be Attila, go nuts and be a killer
And I'm something of a phenom, one puff of the chron'
I'm unstoppable, I'm alive and
On top again, there's no obstacle that I can't conquer
So come along with us (C'mon!)

'Cause what you say is what you say, say what you say
How you say it whenever you sayin' it, just remember
How you said it when you was sprayin' it, so who you playin' with
Huh? (Huh, huh, huh)
'Cause what you say is what you say, say what you say
How you say it whenever you sayin' it, just remember
How you said it when you was sprayin' it, so who you playin' with
Huh? (Huh, huh, huh)

Now anybody who knows Dre knows I'm about
Fast cars and Alizé, partyin' all day
But I handled my business, 'cause it's work before play
Don't look for trouble, but I'll serve you gourmet
However you want it, you can have it your way
You fuck my night up, I'ma fuck up your day
Bullet with your name, sendin' it your way
That goes for anyone who walks through that doorway
'Cause this is my space, you invade it
Live to regret it, and you'll die tryna violate it
Fuck around, get annihilated, eyes dilated
Huh, like my old lady?
'Cause what you say is what you say, sometimes what you mean
Is two different things, depending on your mood if it swings
Think too many things, little hit of Dre's weed
I can do anything, catch a contact
And I'm gone, and I'm back, I speed write
And my loose leaf's my launchpad — And I can pull any string
Don't have to prove anything, catch a contract
On your head, you headed West, talk shit about Dre
You better get a vest and invest in something to protect
Your head and neck — And it's back and forth
All day, like Red and Meth, I joke when I say I'm the best
In the booth, but a lot of truth is said in jest
And if I ever do live to be a legend
I'ma die a sudden death; five mics in The Source?
Ain't holdin' my fuckin' breath, but I'll suffocate for the respect
'Fore I breathe to collect a fuckin' check

'Cause what you say is what you say, say what you say
How you say it whenever you sayin' it, just remember
How you said it when you was sprayin' it, so who you playin' with
Huh? (Huh, huh, huh)
'Cause what you say is what you say, say what you say
How you say it whenever you sayin' it, just remember
How you said it when you was sprayin' it, so who you playin' with
Huh? (Huh, huh, huh)

Watch your fuckin' mouth
Yo, this Timbaland, tell him I said suck my dick

'Cause sometimes you just feel tired, feel weak
(Yo left, yo left, yo left, right, left)
And when you feel weak (Yo left)
You feel like you wanna just give up (Yo left, yo left)
But you gotta search within you (Right, left)
Try to find that inner strength (Yo left, yo left)
And just pull that shit out of you (Yo left)
And get that motivation to not give up (Right, left, yo left)
And not be a quitter, no matter how bad you wanna just fall
(Yo left, yo left, right, left)
Flat on your face and collapse

'Til I collapse I'm spillin' these raps long as you feel 'em
'Til the day that I drop you'll never say that I'm not killin' 'em
'Cause when I am not, then I'ma stop pennin' 'em
And I am not hip-hop and I'm just not Eminem
Subliminal thoughts, when I'ma stop sendin' 'em?
Women are caught in webs, spin 'em and hock venom
Adrenaline shots of penicillin could not get the illin' to stop
Amoxicillin's just not real enough
The criminal, cop-killin', hip-hop villain
A minimal swap to cop millions of Pac listeners
You're comin' with me, feel it or not
You're gonna fear it like I showed you the spirit of God lives in us
You hear it a lot, lyrics to shock
Is it a miracle or am I just product of pop fizzin' up?
Fo' shizzle, my wizzle, this is the plot, listen up
You bizzles forgot, Slizzle does not give a fuck

'Til the roof comes off, 'til the lights go out
'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth
'Til the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps
I'ma rip this shit 'til my bones collapse
(Until the roof) 'Til the roof comes off, 'til the lights go out
(The roof comes off) 'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth
(Until my legs) 'Til the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps
(Give out from underneath me) I'ma rip this shit 'til my bones collapse

Music is like magic, there's a certain feelin' you get
When you real and you spit, and people are feelin' your shit
This is your moment, and every single minute you spend
Tryna hold on to it 'cause you may never get it again
So while you're in it, try to get as much shit as you can
And when your run is over, just admit when it's at its end
'Cause I'm at the end of my wits with half the shit that gets in
I got a list, here's the order of my list that it's in
It goes Reggie, Jay-Z, 2Pac and Biggie
André from OutKast, Jada, Kurupt, Nas, and then me
But in this industry I'm the cause of a lot of envy
So when I'm not put on this list, the shit does not offend me
That's why you see me walk around like nothing's botherin' me
Even though half you people got a fuckin' problem with me
You hate it, but you know respect you got to give me
The press's wet dream, like Bobby and Whitney — Nate, hit me!

'Til the roof comes off, 'til the lights go out
'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth
'Til the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps
I'ma rip this shit 'til my bones collapse
(Until the roof) 'Til the roof comes off, 'til the lights go out
(The roof comes off) 'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth
(Until my legs) 'Til the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps
(Give out from underneath me) I'ma rip this shit 'til my bones collapse

Soon as a verse starts, I eat at an MC's heart
What is he thinking? How not to go against me, smart
And it's absurd how people hang on every word
I'll prob'ly never get the props I feel I ever deserve
But I'll never be served, my spot is forever reserved
If I ever leave Earth, that would be the death of me first
'Cause in my heart of hearts I know nothin' could ever be worse
That's why I'm clever when I put together every verse
My thoughts are sporadic, I act like I'm an addict
I rap like I'm addicted to smack like I'm Kim Mathers
But I don't wanna go forth and back in constant battles
The fact is I would rather sit back and bomb some rappers
So this is like a full-blown attack I'm launchin' at 'em
The track is on some battlin' raps, who wants some static?
'Cause I don't really think that the fact that I'm Slim matters
A plaque and platinum status is whack if I'm not the baddest, so

'Til the roof comes off, 'til the lights go out
'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth
'Til the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps
I'ma rip this shit 'til my bones collapse
(Until the roof) 'Til the roof comes off, 'til the lights go out
(The roof comes off) 'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth
(Until my legs) 'Til the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps
(Give out from underneath me) I'ma rip this shit 'til my bones collapse

Until the roof (Until the roof)
The roof comes off (The roof comes off)
Until my legs (Until my legs)
Give out from underneath me
I, I will not fall, I will stand tall
Feels like no one can beat me

Ayo 50
What I tell you?
We ain't even have to say shit, they did it, ha ha

Monkey see, monkey do
Don't ever make the first move, just let 'em come to you
'Cause they gon' always see and do what the other one do
So let them come to you, the rest'll just follow suit, monkey see, monkey do
Tweedle-dee, tweedle-dum
If they really want it bad enough, well, then they gon' come
Now here they come as we expected, now we just set 'em up
Check-mate, motherfucker, game's over, we won
Tweedle-dee, tweedle-dum

Doesn't take much for me to raise such a stink up
When motherfuckers hate your guts
You ain't even gotta say much
For me to put a pen to a blank sheet of paper
Is like smearing a bloodstain with a paint brush
I can't explain what it is my brain does
But however it works, it's insane, it's plain nuts
And it ain't just my brain that's dangerous
It's a whole combination of things, it takes nuts
And I'm not afraid to raise the stakes up
I got a million bucks in the bank and eight trucks
For anybody who gets on the track and spanks us
I'm patiently waiting for the day, I'm anxious
To see the look on ya fake mugs when you thugs go bankrupt
Ya drunk, you ain't tough
Whatever you drank must've just turned you into some gangstas
This is me talking, motherfucker, this ain't drugs
You wanna pop shit? Wake up then make up
Fuck that! It's too late chump, now face up
I pray for the day that someone who spits with the caliber that Nas and Jay does
Opens up his jaw to say somethin' or rattle my name off
Or rattle the first thing from the top of his brain off
So I can blow the fucking dust off of this chainsaw
And give him the surgery that he came for
'Til I pull the paint off, I never been shot
But I think me and Fifty must've been cut from the same cloth
'Cause I've always came off like Ja's chain when they try to rush him
And lost and came back and gave him a watch in exchange for it
I don't stop, only thing that I wait for
Is the day that I ain't gotta report to probate court
'Cause I'ma give you all a reason to hate more
'Cause I been holding my tongue 'til I got a sprained jaw
A lot of rappers on my list that just ain't Ja
And I'ma read that motherfucker off come April
You pussies think I went soft 'cause 8 Mile
When I come back I'll be shooting more than just paintballs
Trust me

Monkey see, monkey do
Don't ever make the first move, just let 'em come to you
'Cause they gon' always see and do what the other one do
So let them come to you, the rest'll just follow suit, monkey see, monkey do
Tweedle-dee, tweedle-dum
If they really want it bad enough, well, then they gon' come
Now here they come as we expected, now we just set 'em up
Check-mate, motherfucker, game's over, we won
Tweedle-dee, tweedle-dum

Fucking dummies
This ain't chess
You playin' motherfucking checkers
This shit is all day, man, it's too easy
We playing chess, you playing checkers
You 'bout to get your mother fucking asses jumped
Fucking punks
And by the way
We ain't just talking to one person
We talking to every-motherfucking-body who wants to bring it
'Cause we bring it into anybody who wants to bring it
So bring it
Don't pick up the ball if you don't wanna play, man
It's all fucked up now
Fuck I'm supposed to do now?
Huh?!
What the fuck I'm supposed to do?!
Yo, we out!

There's an intruder in my house
He cut my phone line: can't dial out (Shit!)
I scream for police, but I doubt
They're gonna hear me when I shout

A couple of cocktails'll send me to jail
There's a couple of cops hot on my trail, but this time
When I get pulled over there's a Doberman Pinscher
And a pit bull in the seat, these pigs'll get bit
Foolin' with me, quit foolin' with me
Bitch, you're gonna see, no pistol in the seat
Why it always gotta be an issue when you're me?
And which you're gonna see in the long run, I'ma be the wrong one
You wanna harass with this limo-tinted glass
Flashin' that flashlight on my ass — where was you at
Last night when them assholes ran up on my grass?
Rapper slash actor, kiss the crack of my cracker slash ass
They took away my right to bear arms
What I'm 'posed to fight with, bare palms?
Yeah, right! They comin' with bombs
I'm comin' with flare guns; we as Americans

We as Americans, us as a citizen
Gotta protect ourselves, look at how shit has been
We better check ourselves, livin' up in these streets
Through worse and through better health, survivin' by any means
We as Americans, us as a citizen
We are Samaritans, what do we get us in?
We better check ourselves, look at how shit has been
Take a look where you live, this is America, and we are Americans

I make beaucoup bucks, wearin' beaucoup vests
Drama hangin' over my head, like a voodoo hex
I coulda been next to fly over the cuckoo's nest
With you-know-who, with an S tattooed to my chest
But I've finessed it, now I've got the industry pissy
Ever since me and Dre split it fifty-fifty on 50
It's funny, we got a buzz spreadin' quicker
Than makin' paper airplanes out of a twenty
Fuck money! I don't rap for dead presidents
I'd rather see the President [dead]
It's never been said, but I set precedents
And the standards and they can't stand it
My name shoulda been "Bastard", the shit shoulda been plastered
On my forehead with a stamp, I shoulda been blasted
I shoulda been had a cap put in my ass
But I'm too swift and fast for that, I'm past it
I'm too old to go and cruise Gratiot — fuck that shit!
I done seen how fast this rap shit
Can turn into some pap-pap shit, that quick, snap click
But this time, they got the fuckin' automatic
Ain't no one gon' test this man — clack [*click*]

We as Americans, us as a citizen
Gotta protect ourselves, look at how shit has been
We better check ourselves, livin' up in these streets
Through worse and through better health, survivin' by any means
We as Americans, us as a citizen
We are Samaritans, what do we get us in?
We better check ourselves, look at how shit has been
Take a look where you live, this is America, and we are Americans

(Shht!) I got a secret if you can keep it between us
I tuck two ninas under my jeans, either side of my penis
Under my long johns, under my Sean Johns
One run-in with the long arm of the law, I'm long gone
I'ma do five years — no less than that, no questions asked
So it might be a good idea that I stop right here
And quit while I'm ahead, already in the red
Already got a steady infrared meant for my head
A target on my back, bigger problems than that
Bin Laden on my ass, he probably gon' send a task
I ain't gon' even ask, they ain't gon' let me pack
They ain't gon' give me my semi, but I got my weed back

We as Americans, us as a citizen
Gotta protect ourselves, look at how shit has been
We better check ourselves, livin' up in these streets
Through worse and through better health, survivin' by any means
We as Americans, us as a citizen
We are Samaritans, what do we get us in?
We better check ourselves, look at how shit has been
Take a look where you live, this is America, and we are Americans

Still love me? Take this
You ready? One, two, three!

The more you put me through
The more it makes me wanna come back to you
You say you hate me, I just love you more
You don't want me, I just want you more
I buy you flowers, you throw 'em at me
I know it's sad but it's makin' me happy
The more that you slap me, the more that it turns me on
'Cause you love me, and I love you more

It's sick but who could ever predict, we'd be doin' the same shit
We say we do it for our baby but we don't
We do it for us, it's lust 'cause neither one
Of us trust each other, so we fuck 'til we bust
And we cuss each other out, we know what it's about, shout
'Til I throw you out the house, you throw me out the house
I throw you on the couch, punch you in the mouth
Fist fight 'til we turn this mother out
Then apologize after, laughter, pain
It's insane, we're back in the same chapter again
And it's sad but it's true, when I'm layin' here with you
There ain't nothin' anyone could ever say or ever do 'cause

The more you put me through
The more it makes me wanna come back to you
You say you hate me, I just love you more
You don't want me, I just want you more
I buy you flowers, you throw 'em at me
I know it's sad but it's makin' me happy
The more that you slap me, the more that it turns me on
'Cause you love me, and I love you more

'Cause I hate you, do you hate me?
Good, 'cause you're so fuckin' beautiful when you're angry
It makes me wanna just take you and just throw you
On the bed and fuck you like I don't even know you
You fuck other people and I fuck other people
You're a slut, but I'm equal, I'm a mutt, we're both evil
In our ways but neither one of us would ever admit it
'Cause one us would have one up on the other so forget it
We can make accusations, people spread rumors
But they ain't got proof, 'til they do it's just the two of us
It's you and me, 'cause any chick can say that she screwin' me
But you gotta believe me to a degree 'cause true indeed
If you didn't, I wouldn't be hittin' — yeah, I would
'Cause the sex is too damn good, if I ran who would I run to
That would be this soft and warm?
So it's off and on, usually more off than on
But at least we know that we share this common bond
You're the only one I can fuck without a condom on
I hope, the only reason that I cope is 'cause of that fact
And plus I can bust in that and that's why

The more you put me through
The more it makes me wanna come back to you
You say you hate me, I just love you more
You don't want me, I just want you more
I buy you flowers, you throw 'em at me
I know it's sad but it's makin' me happy
The more that you slap me, the more that it turns me on
'Cause you love me, and I love you more

I can never understand it, that's why I don't try
From junior high until we both die, it's silly
Oh, why must we try? Is it really so rough
That we must always call each other's Billy Goat's Gruff?
Try to pull each other's legs, until the other begs
We're lyin' to ourselves, that's the beauty of it, yeah!
'Cause we truly love each other, that's why we always fightin'
All we do is shove each other every other fuckin' night
And it's clear it ain't gonna change, it's pent-up rage
We both had, we both feel like we've been upstaged
By someone else, we've both been someone else's
"Someone else," problem is neither one wants help
It's an addiction and it can't be fixed
Our family's mixed up, there's a baby sister in the mix
And it hurts 'cause the pieces to the puzzle don't fit
And anybody who thinks they know us doesn't know shit
And they're probably just tired of hearin' it all the time
On every song, every lyric and every rhyme
All the hoopla, all of the whoopty-woo
What you put me through, fuckin' whoopty-do
But I won't be made a fool of if this is true love
You wouldn't do what you did last time, you wouldn't screw up
This time, 'cause this time, girl, I'm tellin' you what
You do it again, I'm fuckin' you up

No matter what you say, or what you do
I'ma hunt you down 'til I find you
No matter where you run, I'll be right there
Right behind you, in your nightmares
So I brought you the flowers and the candy
All the times that you threw it back at me
Told me you hate me, you gon' hate me more
When you find out, you can't escape me, whore

The more you put me through
The more it makes me wanna come back to you
You say you hate me, I just love you more
You don't want me, I just want you more
I buy you flowers, you throw 'em at me
I know it's sad but it's makin' me happy
The more that you slap me, the more that it turns me on
'Cause you love me, and I love you more

"Uncle Marshall, will you tell us a bedtime story?"
Here we go!

Now, once upon a time not long ago
There was a little rapper about to blow
But his album came, and it was not good
I think it went lead or double copper-wood
So these silly little fans, they were misled
By a nerdy Internet computer hip-hop head
"Me and you, Clef, we're gonna make some cash."
"Grab this silver paint and just paint my ass."
Hey, mister, would you care to bear witness to
The ass-whippin' I'm about to administer
To this ass-kissin' little vaginal blister?
Stanibus, little Marshall Mathers' sister
And in this corner, we have the "Mr
Not-Havin'-It," it's the Mad, sinister
Dr. Evil, with his bag of tricks for
This little antagonistic faggot
Dick-sucking ex-LL Cool J fan from Windsor
I'm 'bout to murder little Kenny-Fag-Kaniff-sta
You bastard, I ain't wanna have to diss ya
Canibus, where the fuck you at? I miss ya!

Canibitch, oh, Canibitch
Wherefore art thou, Canibitch?
Please tell me what happened with
That style that you were rappin' with
Canibitch, oh, Canibitch
Are you from Los Angeles
New York, or just a janitor
From Canada? Oh, Canibitch

Now, at first, I ain't really understand this shit
Picture me, for a second, and imagine it
Chillin' in the Bat Mansion relaxin' when
All of a sudden some bullshit comes across the scanners, it's
Canibitch, on some 'Stan Lives' shit
It creeped me out at first; man, this is sick
But me, bein' just as sick, this conflict
Gets my dick harder than arithmetic
And I know how you jealous ones envy
I shoulda knew better from the first few letters you sent me
The first two letters, you were tellin' me shit like
You respect me, like any other regular MC
The third letter, you asked how come I ain't return
None of the messages at Shady Records you left me
The fourth letter: "Slim, you're really startin' to upset me."
The fifth letter told me you were comin' to get me
The sixth letter, there's a bomb threat on our building
This crazy motherfucker's really tryna kill me
So I went back and read the first few letters that said
Some shit about a message you left
Oh shit! That's not a E, that's an A!
This dude wants to leave me a 'massage,' he's gay!
Right away, I'm on the phone with Dr. Dre
"We got a bogey," "Marshall, I'm on the way."

Canibitch, oh, Canibitch
Wherefore art thou, Canibitch?
Please tell me what happened with
That style that you were rappin' with
Canibitch, oh, Canibitch
Are you from Los Angeles
New York, or just a janitor
From Canada? Oh, Canibitch

So, in two seconds flat, Dre's at my crib
Only thing is, we both know where this kid lives
And neither one of us have Canadian citizenship
"Shit. Oh, Dre, wait a minute, that's it!
All we gotta do is use a bit of turbo-boost
We can fly over the border!" "Let's Go!"
So we're off to Toronto and we're gainin' speed
"What was that? Oh, Jermaine Dupri."
"Fuck it," keep goin', no time to waste
"Wait, back up. Hit him one more time, in case."
"Okay," fuck, now he's draggin' under the car
"Oh well, only thirty more thousand miles!"
Meanwhile, me and Dre are tryna conversate
Just tryna find a reason for the constant hate
And tryna figure out what happened to 'Germaine Propane'
"He couldn't have fell off that hard." Ain't no way!
What happened to the way you was rappin'
When you was scandalous?
That Canibus turned into a television evangelist!
Plus, he raps with his regular voice
"What was that?" "Pet Shop Boys."
So, we pull up to the bridge where he last was spotted
His corpse was still movin', but his ass was rotted
And he kinda smelled a little like Courtney Love
I figured if I stick him with a fork, he's done
So I stabbed him twice, kept jabbin'—Christ!
He won't die! This guy's like a battered wife!
He's like Kim: he keeps comin' back for more
But he won't fight back, I cracked his jaw
Hold up! 'Bis, quit foldin' up!
Punch me in the chest, make my shoulders touch
Do something! At least one punchline!
Come on! 'Til the meter reads Nine! Nine! Nine-
Ty nine percent of my fans are blond!
'Bis, come on, answer me, man, respond!
Tell me 'bout the sun, rain, moon and stars!
Intergalactical metaphors from Mars!
Raw to the floor, raw like Reservoir Dogs!
Bite another line from Redman's song!
Suddenly, the stub of a dead man's arm
From a midget reaches out from under the car
It's J.D.! This motherfucker won't die, neither!
Dre starts sprayin' him with cans of ether
We swamped the bitch in it; stomped the bitch again
"Compton!" "Detroit, bitch, talk some shit again!"
"Stomp him!" "Switch feet!" "Stomp him!" "Switch again!"
"Dre, all right, he's dead, dog, quit kickin' him!
I think Stanibus jumped off the bridge again!" ("Ahh!")
"Damn," "He disappeared, yo, he's gone, he did it again!"

Canibitch, oh, Canibitch
Wherefore art thou, Canibitch?
Please tell me what happened with
That style that you were rappin' with
Canibitch, oh, Canibitch
Are you from Los Angeles
New York, or just a janitor
From Canada? Oh, Canibitch

Yo, check it out, it's fucked up, 'cause I don't see either one of us budging

"I'm withholding my anger
Though I'd like to be the strangler
Of this punk ass little pussy's puny neck
It's my right to insist
That he acknowledge my existence
But he just displays complete lack of respect"
That's what he says to himself
As he uses his magazines to trash me
As he sits with both his feet up at his desk
Smokes a bag of his weed
And starts imagining things
And he just can't see that he's manically depressed
And in his jealousy and envy
It just whirls him in a frenzy
As he turns on MTV and sees my face
He don't exist in this world
So he just twists and he twirls
Spirals and spins 'til he hurls himself into rage
And it's destroying him slowly
'Cause he does not even know me
Even though he sees me everywhere he goes
So he just tortures himself
He has no fortune and wealth
So he extorts someone else to get his dough
And now he's acting like a bully
So he tries to push and pull me
But he knows that he can't fool me so he's mad
He has no choice but to scream
And raise his voice up at me
'Cause it annoys him to see that I ain't scared

You ain't no motherfucking bully
And I ain't bowing to no motherfucking bully
I won't allow it, ain't gon' cower to no bully
I'll be damned if I don't stand up to a bully
Fight like a man and throw my hands up to a bully
And I know it must be fucking with you emotionally

Now I'm not trying to make no more enemies
No more unfortunately
There's so many other motherfuckers there just are
They just keep hounding at me
Now that I'm down with 50
Suddenly now I got beef with this faggot Ja (Ha-ha-ha-ha)
But his ass is such a puppet
Irv could shove his whole hand up it
And just make him say what he wants him to say
But Suge has Irv on a string
And Irv's so nervous that he
Says anything to this man to keep him at bay
So now Ja thinks that he's so tough
And Murder Inc.'s the big bad wolf
And they go huff and puff and blow our label down
But our building's made out of bricks
So you ain't taking out shit
And dog you just did a song with Bobby Brown
So now you try to pull the race card
And it backfires in your face hard
'Cause you know we don't play that black and white shit
Plus this stylist you fucked
When you was ecstasied up
Was just a man who's dressed up as a white bitch

You ain't no motherfucking bully
And I ain't bowing to no motherfucking bully
I won't allow it, ain't gon' cower to no bully
I'll be damned if I don't stand up to a bully
Fight like a man and throw my hands up to a bully
You must be taking too much E

Now what bothers me the most
About hip-hop is we're so close
To picking up where we left off with Big and Pac
We just lost Jam Master J
Big L got blasted away
Plus we lost Bugz, Slang Ton, and Freaky Tah
It's like a never-ending cycle
That just seems to come full circle
Everybody's gotta be so fucking hard
And I'm not excluding myself
'Cause I been stupid as well
I been known to lose it when someone says something smart
But as we grow as men
We learn to let shit go, but then again
There's only so much bullshit we can really stand
We all got reps to uphold
When someone steps on our toes
It's no exception, it goes for every man
But if Irv really gave a fuck
About Ja like he claims he does
He'd wake him up and make his boy get off them drugs
But he just keeps feeding him pills
So if that E doesn't kill him
Someone from G-Unit will and I ain't buzzed
Dawg, I'm talking to you straight
If the situation escalates
Any worse, we're gonna lose another soldier to this game
And if I get killed for this rap
I got a million in cash
That says I will get you back in Hailie's name

You ain't no motherfucking bully
And I ain't bowing to no motherfucking bully
I won't allow it, ain't gon' cower to no bully
I'll be damned if I don't stand up to a bully
Fight like a man and throw my hands up to a bully
Irvine, get your boy off of that E

Get at me, dog
Holla

Good morning! Ha ha!
Wake your motherfucking asses up!
Are y'all with us or what?
Well, come on then, you know what time it is
Stop sleeping on my group, bitch!

For whatever it's worth it's worth me havin' my ass whipped
'Cause I'ma have the last lips to ever kiss ass with
I just can't get past these little piss ants
That wanna be brawny bad asses so bad
And they so mad they can't stand it
'Cause we can and they can't spit
And they can't handle it like a man
And that's when it just happens
And I snap and it's a wrap, and it's scrap and then it isn't rap, is it?
Hip-Hop isn't a sport anymore when you gotta go and resort back into that shit
Maybe I'm old-fashioned but my passion is to smash anyone rappin' without havin' to slap him
Believe me, I'd much rather lift a pencil than a pistol when I'm pissed now
But it all depends on just how far it gets took on the mic
'Cause I'm tellin' you right now, you're not gonna like it
'Cause if I get pushed over the edge then I'm pullin' you with me
You poke a stick at a pitbull, you get bit, B
These words stick to you like Krazy Glue when you diss me
'Cause they just bounce off me, like bullets to 50
I'm the beautiful-lest thing and you gonna miss me when I'm gone
Like Keith Murray when he threw a stool and hit a girl accidentally
I do this for Swifty, Kon and Kuniva, Bizzy & Proof, are you with me?

Come on then, everybody come on and
Kick your shoes off motherfuckers, come on in
'Cause we get it on until the break of dawn and
Wake your ass up motherfuckers, quit yawning
'Cause we ain't leaving 'til 6 in the morning
So have a sing along with the words of the song and
If you don't know the words and you can't sing along then
Fake like you know 'em motherfuckers and join in
Everybody good morning

They consider me the epitome me of a beef starter
In a party with heat, it's hard to keep me without one
Fuck slugs, I'm walkin' gloves with a shotgun
Constantly poppin' slugs, they hot son, better not run
The bosses of all bosses; a holocaust to whoever ain't conscious
In a house full of dog shit
I'm a Gothic death project, you stop breathin'
You die quicker than Mach speed without bleedin'
It ain't about what you readin'
When you meet me better speak like a season's greetings
Either that or we'll be beefin' frequent
You niggas need an 'E' just to speak shit
Your leader's a petite bitch
Keep the heater where you can reach quick
I snipe you with it and we won't even keep it a secret
Nigga I did it from the mind of a mental patient
When Glocks wave you can save that conversation for Satan
You brave?

Come on then, everybody come on and
Kick your shoes off motherfuckers, come on in
'Cause we get it on until the break of dawn and
Wake your ass up motherfuckers, quit yawning
'Cause we ain't leaving 'til 6 in the morning
So have a sing along with the words of the song and
If you don't know the words and you can't sing along then
Fake like you know 'em motherfuckers and join in
Everybody good morning

I heard you niggas don't like us but so what?
This beef is like "What the fuck did he say in his rap, Em?"
I can see that he's just a punk
I mean these niggas squeeze on me
Please I'm seeing guts
I don't need no enemies, as my family a couple trucks and my MPC and a mic
They empty out on them bike to fight you
In front of every reporter that I don't like
No need for metaphors to get points across when I write
This emotion's enough to say: "Fuck you bitch and I don't like you!"
What! I might as well give this up but that'd be, selfish as fuck
To leave D12 in this but we can't self-destruct
I've never felt it this much, c'mon fellas get up!
We gotta fight like Bugz last night of his life, c'mon!

I walk with a limp, pistol hanging off of the hip
I'm awkward and quick enough and sick when sparking a fifth
Your carcass is split, even if beef is partially thick
We can't take you seriously, you a comedy skit
You probably wish that you could be out, shooting at Gs
But the only thing you shoot is the breeze, I can't believe
You speaking on moving keys, but every time we hear you kick it
The only thing that you selling is woof tickets
I look wicked 'cause niggas'll test your nutsack
So when they bust, you better bust back or get your guts clapped outta your stomach
And when they want it I'll bring a hundred niggas from Runyon so get to gunnin' if you coming

Come on then, everybody come on and
Kick your shoes off motherfuckers, come on in
'Cause we get it on until the break of dawn and
Wake your ass up motherfuckers, quit yawning
'Cause we ain't leaving 'til 6 in the morning
So have a sing along with the words of the song and
If you don't know the words and you can't sing along then
Fake like you know 'em motherfuckers and join in
Everybody good morning

Lord, please forgive me for what I do
For I know not what I've done

Father, please forgive me for I know not what I do
I just never had the chance to ever meet you
Therefore I did not know that I would grow to be
My mother's evil seed and do these evil deeds

Momma had a baby and it's head popped off (head popped off
Head popped off, head popped off, head popped off, head popped off)
My momma don't want me the next thing I know I'm gettin' dropped off
(Gettin' dropped off, gettin' dropped off, gettin' dropped off, gettin' dropped off)
Ring ring ring on the door bell and the next door neighbors on their front porch
(Their front porch, their front porch, their front porch, their front porch)
But they didn't want me neither so they left me on someone else's lawn
(Else's lawn, else's lawn, else's lawn) 'til somebody finally took me in
My great aunt and uncle, Edna 'n Charles (Edna 'n Charles
Edna 'n Charles, Edna 'n Charles, Edna 'n Charles)
They were the ones who were left in charge
My elementary they ganged up on me and sang this song
(Sang this song, sang this song, sang this song, sang this song)
It went a little something like
Mary had a little lamb, little lamb, little lamb
Debbie had a Satan spawn, Satan spawn
Momma why do they keep saying this I just don't understand, understand
And by the way, where's my daaaaaaaaaaad?

Father, please forgive me for I know not what I do
I just never had the chance to ever meet you
Therefore I did not know that I would grow to be
My mother's evil seed and do these evil deeds

Predominantly, predominantly, everything's always predominantly
Predominantly white, predominantly black, well what about me
Where does that leave me? Well I guess that I'm between predominantly
Both of 'em, I think if I hear that fuckin' word again I'mma scream
While I'm projectile vomiting, what do I look like, a comedian to you?
Do you think that I'm kidding? What do I look like some kind of idi-
Wait a minute, shit, don't answer that why am I so misunderstood?
Why do I go through so much bullshit, it's such bullshit, it's tush mull bish
Woe is me, there goes poor Marshall again whinin about his millions
And his mansion and his sorrow he's always drownin' in
From the dad that he never had, and how his childhood was so bad
And how his mom was a dope addict, and his ex-wife how they go at it
Man I'd hate to have it, as bad as that Mr. Mathers, claims he had it
I can't imagine it, that little rich poor white bastard
Needs to take some of that cash out of the bank and take a bath in it
Man if I only had half of it
Shit, if you only knew the half of it
Haha

Father, please forgive me for I know not what I do
I just never had the chance to ever meet you
Therefore I did not know that I would grow to be
My mother's evil seed and do these evil deeds

Evil deeds, while I plant these evil seeds
Please release me from these demons
I never had any of this shit planned, mom, please believe
I don't wanna be Satan's spawn, never got the chance to say I'm sorry
Now look at all the pain I caused
Dear Santa Claus, why you not comin' this year again?
What did I do that was so bad to deserve this?
Everything could have been so perfect
But life ain't a fairytale, I'm about to be hoisted up in the air
Forty feet below me, there's people everywhere
I don't even know but it feel like they know me cause I'm in this ferris wheel
And all I wanna do is go to the mall and take Hailie on the carousel
Without this crowd everywhere I go, but life is like a merry-go-round
Here we go now, doe-se-doe now, curtains up, the show must go
Now ring around the rosie, the show's over, you can all go home now
But the curtain just don't close for me, this ain't how fame is supposed to be
Where's the switch I could just turn off and on, this ain't what I chose to be
So please God, give me the strength to have what it takes to carry on
'Til I pass 50 back the baton, the camera's on, my soul is gone

Father, please forgive me for I know not what I do
I just never had the chance to ever meet you
Therefore I did not know that I would grow to be
My mother's evil seed and do these evil deeds

I said, father, please forgive me for I know not what I do
I just never had the chance to ever meet you
Therefore I did not know that I would grow to be
My mother's evil seed and do these evil deeds
(Evil deeds, evil deeds, evil deeds)

Oh!

Last one, baby, let's go
Last one, baby, let's go
Detroit!

There's not much you could do or say to faze me
People think I'm a little bit crazy
I get it from all angles, even occasionally Doc Dre-zie
Will have to step in every once in a while to save me
To make me stop and think about it 'fore I just say things
Sometimes I forget what other people just may think
A lot of rappers probably wouldn't know how to take me
If they heard some shit, I'd lay the tape 'fore they erased me
I may be a little too fast-paced and racy
Sometimes the average listener rewinds and plays me
Twenty times 'cause I say so many rhymes it may seem
Like I'm goin' too fast 'cause my mind is racing
And I could give a fuck what category you place me
Long as when I'm pushing up daisies
And gone as long as you place me amongst one of them greats
When I hit the heavenly gates I'll be cool beside Jay-Z
For every single die-hard fan who embraced me
I'm thankful for the talent in which God gave me
And I'm thankful for the environment that he placed me
Believe it or not, I thank my mom for how she raised me
In the neighborhood daily that jumped and chased me
It only made me what I am today, see
Regardless of what anybody believes who hates me
You ain't gonna make or break me
Tryna strip me of my credibility and make me look fake, G
You're only gonna be in for a rude awakening
'Cause sooner or later you haters are all gonna face me
And when you face me with all the shit you've been saving
To say to me, you had all this time to think about it
Now don't pussy out and try to about face me
'Cause I've been patiently waiting for the day
That we finally meet in the same place to see

No matter how many battles I been in and won
No matter how many magazines on my nuts
No matter how many MCs I eat up
Oh, it's never enough
No matter how many battles I been in and won
No matter how many magazines on my nuts
No matter how many MCs I eat up
Oh oh, it's never enough

My flow's untouchable, now you gotta face it
Uh oh, it gets worse when I go back to the basics
You gon' say the wrong shit and get your whole face split
The smell of victory, love it so much I can taste it
I spot my target, blaze it, direct hit
Graze it, your peace talk, save it
Your shit sounds dated, you're overrated
I'm obligated to study your moves then crush you motherfuckers
If I'm the best and the worst, then God's gift is a curse
Soldier trained to destroy – you payin' attention, boy?
I spit shit, slick shit, so quick you miss it
To be specific I go ballistic as hieroglyphic
My music is a drug, press play, you ain't gotta sniff it
Shoot it or pop it, roll it, bag it or chop it
It'll get you high over and over, but you gotta cop it
When it's hot, it's hot, your hatin' is undeniable, stop it

No matter how many battles I been in and won
No matter how many magazines on my nuts
No matter how many MCs I eat up
Oh, it's never enough
No matter how many battles I been in and won
No matter how many magazines on my nuts
No matter how many MCs I eat up
Oh oh, it's never enough

What we have to do is deal with it when these individuals are young enough. If you will to be
Saved, not in a religious sense but not to constitute what this country at times calls their throwaway children. We seem to be approaching (C'mon!) an age of the gross. We all have this idea that we should
Move up a little bit from our parents' station and each generation should do a little bit better

All right, come on, let's cut the bullshit enough
Let's get it started, let's start addressing this issue and open it up
Let's take this shit back to the basement
And we can discuss statements that's made on this tape
And its whole origin of the music that we all know and love
The music we all enjoy
The music you accuse me of tryna destroy
Let's rewind it to '89 when I was a boy on the east side of Detroit
Crossing 8 Mile into Warren, into hick territory
I'd like to share a story, this is my story and can't nobody tell it for me
You have well informed me, I am well aware that I don't belong here
You've made that perfectly clear, I get my ass kicked damn near everywhere
From Bel-Aire shopping center just for stopping in there
From the black side all the way to the white side
OK there's a bright side a day that I might slide
You may call it a pass I call it hauling my ass
Through that patch of grass over them railroad tracks
Oh them railroad tracks, them old railroad tracks
Them good old notorious so well-known tracks

So let's go back
Follow the yellow brick road as we go on another episode
Journey with me as I take you through this nifty little place
That I once used to call home sweet home

Come on let's go back
Follow the yellow brick road as we go on another episode
Journey with me as I take you through this nifty little place
That I once used to call home sweet home

I'd roam the streets so much they'd call me a drifter
Sometimes I'd stick up a thumb just to hitchhike
Just to get picked up to get me a lift to 8 Mile and Van Dyke
And steal a goddamn bike from somebody's backyard
And drop it off at the park that was the half-way mark
To meet Kim had to walk back to her mama's on Chalmers after dark
To sneak me in the house when I'm kicked out my mom's
That's about the time I first met Proof with Goofy Gary on the steps
At Osbourne handing out some flyers, he was doing some talent shows
At Center Line High, I had told him to stop by and check this out sometime
He looked at me like I'm out my mind shook his head like, "White boys don't know how to rhyme."
I spit out a line and rhymed "birthday" with "first place"
And we both had the same rhymes that sound alike
We was on the same shit that Big Daddy Kane shit where compound syllables sound combined
From that day we was down to ride somehow we knew we'd meet again somewhere down the line

So let's go back
Follow the yellow brick road as we go on another episode
Journey with me as I take you through this nifty little place
That I once used to call home sweet home

Come on let's go back
Follow the yellow brick road as we go on another episode
Journey with me as I take you through this nifty little place
That I once used to call home sweet home

My first year in 9th grade, can't forget that day at school
It was cool 'til your man MC Shan came through
And said that Puma's The Brand 'cause the Klan makes Troops
It was rumors but man, goddamn, they flew
Must've been true because man we done banned they shoes
I had the new ones the Cool J, Ice Lamb suede too
But we just threw 'em in the trash like they yesterday's news
Guess who came through next, X-Clan debut
Professor X (Vanglorious!)
Exist in a state of red, black, and green
With a key sissies now with this being a new trend
We don't fit in crackers is out with Cactus albums
Blackness is in, African symbols and medallions
Represents Black Power and we ain't know what it meant
Me and my man Howard and Butta would go to the mall with 'em
All over our necks like we're showing 'em off not knowing at all
We was being laughed at "You ain't even half black."
You ain't 'posed to have that homie let me grab that
And that Flavor Flav clock we gon' have to snatch that
All I remember is meeting back at Manix's basement
Saying how we hate this, how racist but dope the X Clan's tape is
Which reminds me back in '89 me and Kim broke up for the first time
She was tryna two-time me and there was this black girl
At our school who thought I was cool 'cause I rapped so she was kinda eyeing me
And oh the irony guess what her name was ain't even gonna say it plus
The same color hair as hers was and blue contacts and a pair of jugs
The bombest goddamn girl in our whole school if I could pull her
Not only would I become more popular but I would be able to piss Kim off at the same time
But it backfired I was supposed to dump her but she dumped me for this black guy
And that's the last I ever seen or heard or spoke to the "Ole Foolish Pride" girl
But I've heard people say they heard the tape and it ain't that bad
But it was I singled out a whole race and for that I apologize
I was wrong 'cause no matter what color a girl is she's still a hoe

So let's go back
Follow the yellow brick road as we go on another episode
Journey with me as I take you through this nifty little place
That I once used to call home sweet home

Come on let's go back
Follow the yellow brick road as we go on another episode
Journey with me as I take you through this nifty little place
That I once used to call home sweet home

Fuck out of my house, you fuckin' pieces of shit!
Get the fuck out of my house, you stupid fucker!
You son of a bitch!

Step by step, heart to heart, left right left
We all fall down

Step by step, heart to heart, left right left
We all fall down like toy soldiers
Bit by bit, torn apart, we never win
But the battle wages on for toy soldiers

I'm supposed to be the soldier who never blows his composure
Even though I hold the weight of the whole world on my shoulders
I ain't never supposed to show it, my crew ain't supposed to know it
Even if it means goin' toe to toe with a Benzino it don't matter
I'd never drag them in battles that I can't handle unless I absolutely have to
I'm supposed to set an example
I need to be the leader, my crew looks for me to guide 'em
If some shit ever does pop off, I'm supposed to be beside 'em
That Ja shit I tried to squash it, it was too late to stop it
There's a certain line you just don't cross and he crossed it
I heard him say Hailie's name on a song and I just lost it
It was crazy, this shit went way beyond some Jay-z and Nas shit
And even though the battle was won, I feel like we lost it
I spent so much energy on it, honestly I'm exhausted
And I'm so caught in it I almost feel I'm the one who caused it
This ain't what I'm in hip-hop for, it's not why I got in it
That was never my object for someone to get killed
Why would I wanna destroy something I help build
It wasn't my intentions, my intentions were good
I went through my whole career without ever mentionin'
And that was just out of respect for not runnin' my mouth
And talkin' about something that I knew nothing about
Plus Dre told me stay out, this just wasn't my beef
So I did, I just fell back, watched and gritted my teeth
While he's all over T.V. down talkin' a man who literally saved my life
Like fuck it I understand this is business
And this shit just isn't none of my business
But still knowin' this shit could pop off at any minute cause

Step by step, heart to heart, left right left
We all fall down like toy soldiers
Bit by bit, torn apart, we never win
But the battle wages on for toy soldiers

There used to be a time when you could just say a rhyme
And wouldn't have to worry about one of your people dyin'
But now it's elevated cause once you put someone's kids in it
The shit gets escalated, it ain't just words no more is it?
It's a different ball game, you call names and you ain't just rappin'
We actually tried to stop the 50 and Ja beef from happenin'
Me and Dre had sat with him, kicked it and had a chat with him
And asked him not to start it he wasn't gonna go after him
Until Ja started yappin' in magazines how we stabbed him
Fuck it 50 smash him! Mash on him and let him have it
Meanwhile my attention's pulled in another direction
Some receptionist at The Source who answers phones at his desk
Has an erection for me and thinks that I'll be his resurrection
Tries to blow the dust off his mic and make a new record
But now he's fucked the game up cause one of the ways I came up
Was through that publication the same one that made me famous
Now the owner of it has got a grudge against me for nothin'
Well fuck it, that motherfucker could get it too, fuck him then
But I'm so busy being pissed off I don't stop to think
That we just inherited 50's beef with Murder Inc
And he's inherited mine which is fine ain't like either of us mind
We still have soldiers that's on the front line
That's willing to die for us as soon as we give the orders
Never to extort us, strictly to show they support us
We'll maybe shout 'em out in a rap or up in a chorus
To show them we love 'em back and let 'em know how important it is
To have Runyan Avenue, soldiers up in our corners
Their loyalty to us is worth more than any award is
But I ain't tryna have none of my people hurt and murdered
It ain't worth it, I can't think of a perfecter way to word it
Than to just say that I love ya'll too much to see the verdict
I'll walk away from it all 'fore I let it go any further
But don't get it twisted, it's not a plea that I'm coppin'
I'm just willin' to be the bigger man
If ya'll can quit poppin' off at the jaws, well then I can
Cause frankly I'm sick of talkin'
I'm not gonna let someone else's coffin rest on my conscience cause

Step by step, heart to heart, left right left
We all fall down like toy soldiers
Bit by bit, torn apart, we never win
But the battle wages on for toy soldiers

I pledge allegiance to the flag
Of the United States of America
And to the republic for which it stands (People)
One nation, under God, indivisible
With liberty and justice for all (It feels so good to be back)
(Mosh with me now)

Scrutinize every word, memorize every line
I spit it once, refuel, re-energize, and rewind
I give sight to the blind, my insight through the mind
I exercise my right to express when I feel it's time
It's just all in your mind, what you interpret it as
I say to fight, you take it as "I'ma whip someone's ass"
And if you don't understand, don't even bother to ask
A father who has grown up with a fatherless past
Who has blown up now to rap phenomenon that has
Or at least shows no difficulty multitaskin'
And juggling both, perhaps mastered his craft slash
Entrepreneur who's helped launch a few more rap acts
Who's had a few obstacles thrown his way through the last half
Of his career, typical manure, movin' past that
Mr. Kiss-His-Ass-Crack, he's a class act
Rubber Band Man, yeah, he just snaps back

Come along, follow me as I lead through the darkness
As I provide just enough spark that we need
To proceed, carry on, give me hope
Give me strength, come with me and I won't steer you wrong
Put your faith and your trust as I guide us through the fog
To the light at the end of the tunnel, we gon' fight, we gon' charge
We gon' stomp, we gon' march through the swamp
We gon' mosh through the marsh, take us right through the doors, come on

All the people up top, on the side and the middle
Come together, let's all form and swarm just a little
Just let it gradually build from the front to the back
All you can see is a sea of people, some white and some black
Don't matter what color, all that matters we're gathered together
To celebrate for the same cause no matter the weather
If it rains, let it rain, yeah, the wetter, the better
They ain't gon' stop us, they can't, we're stronger now more than ever
They tell us no, we say yeah, They tell us stop, we say go
Rebel with a rebel yell, raise hell, we gon' let 'em know
Stomp, push, shove, mush, fuck Bush
Until they bring our troops home, come on, just

Come along, follow me as I lead through the darkness
As I provide just enough spark that we need
To proceed, carry on, give me hope
Give me strength, come with me and I won't steer you wrong
Put your faith and your trust as I guide us through the fog
To the light at the end of the tunnel, we gon' fight, we gon' charge
We gon' stomp, we gon' march through the swamp
We gon' mosh through the marsh, take us right through the doors, come on

Imagine it pourin', just rainin' down on us
Moshpits outside the Oval Office
Someone's tryna tell us somethin', maybe this is God just
Sayin' we're responsible for this monster, this coward
That we have empowered, this is Bin Laden
Look at his head noddin'
How could we allow somethin' like this without pumpin' our fists?
Now this is our final hour
Let me be the voice and your strength and your choice
Let me simplify the rhyme just to amplify the noise
Try to amplify it, times it, and multiply it by six
'Teen million people all equal at this high pitch
Maybe we can reach Al-Qaeda through my speech
Let the president answer a higher anarchy
Strap him with an AK-47, let him go
Fight his own war, let him impress daddy that way
No more blood for oil
We got our own battles to fight on our own soil
No more psychological warfare
To trick us to thinkin' that we ain't loyal
If we don't serve our own country, we're patronizin' a hero
Look in his eyes, it's all lies
The stars and stripes have been swiped, washed out, and wiped
And replaced with his own face, mosh now or die
If I get sniped tonight, you'll know why
'Cause I told you to fight

So come along, follow me as I lead through the darkness
As I provide just enough spark that we need
To proceed, carry on, give me hope
Give me strength, come with me and I won't steer you wrong
Put your faith and your trust as I guide us through the fog
To the light at the end of the tunnel, we gon' fight, we gon' charge
We gon' stomp, we gon' march through the swamp
We gon' mosh through the marsh, take us right through the doors, come on

And as we proceed
To mosh through this desert storm
And these closing statements
If they should argue, let us beg to differ
As we set aside our differences
And assemble our own army
To disarm this weapon of mass destruction
That we call our president for the present
And mosh for the future of our next generation
To speak and be heard
Mr. President, Mr. Senator
Can you guys hear us?

There I go, thinking of you again

You don't know how sick you make me
You make me fucking sick to my stomach
Every time I think of you I puke
You must just not know
You may not think you do, but you do
Every time I think of you I puke

I was gonna take the time to sit down and write you a little poem
But off of the dome would probably be a little more
More suitable for this type of song, whoa
I got a million reasons off the top of my head that I could think of
Sixteen bars this ain't enough to put some ink to
So fuck it, I'ma start right here, I'll just be brief, I'm
'Bout to rattle off some of the reasons
I knew I shouldn't go and get another tattoo
Of you on my arm, but what do I go and do?
I go and get another one, now I got two (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
Now I'm sitting here with your name on my skin
I can't believe I went and did this stupid shit again
My next girlfriend, now her name's gotta be Kim (Shit)
If you only knew how much I hated you
For every motherfucking thing you've ever put us through
Then I wouldn't be standing here crying over you (Boo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-hoo)

You don't know how sick you make me
You make me fucking sick to my stomach
Every time I think of you I puke
You must just not know
You may not think you do, but you do
Every time I think of you I puke

I was gonna take the time to sit down and write you a little letter
But I thought a song would probably be a little better
Instead of a letter that you'd probably just shred up, yeah
I stumbled on your picture yesterday and it made me stop and think of
How much of a waste it'd be for me to put some ink to, a stupid piece of
Paper, I'd rather let you see how
Much I fucking hate you in a freestyle
You're a fucking cokehead slut, I hope you fucking die, ho
I hope you get to hell and Satan sticks a needle in your eye
I hate your fucking guts, you fucking slut, I hope you die (Die)
But please don't get me wrong, I'm not bitter or mad
It's not that I still love you, it's not 'cause I want you back
It's just that when I think of you it makes me wanna yack (Ack)
What else can I do? I haven't got a clue
Now I guess I'll just move on, I have no choice but to
But every time I think of you now all I wanna do is puke

You don't know how sick you make me
You make me fucking sick to my stomach
Every time I think of you I puke
You must just not know
You may not think you do, but you do
Every time I think of you I puke

Ah, damn!
Fucking bitch

Oh! Yeah! So much for first single on this one

Shady's the label, Aftermath is the stable
That the horses come out of—erra
Of course we're about to stir up
Some shit thick as Mrs. Buttersworth's syrup
It's the Mr. Picked-on-Christopher-Reeves-just-for-no-reason
Other than to—just to tease him
'Cause he was his biggest [*burp*] fan
He used to be Superman, now I'm pourin'
Liquor on the curb in his name for him
"Eminem, you wait 'til we meet up again, fucker
I'm kickin' your ass for everything you've ever said."
It goes one for the money, two for the fuckin' show
Ready, get set, let's go
Here comes the buckin' bronco
Stompin' and stampedin' up the damn street like them buffalo
Soldiers, I told ya I'm 'bout to blow, so look out below, Geronimo
Motherfuckers, it's dominoes, I'm on a roll
Around and around I go
When will I stop? I don't know
Tryin' to pick up where The Eminem Show left off
But I know anything's possible
Though I'm not gonna top what I sold
I'm at the top of my game, that shit is not gonna change
Long as I got Dr. Dre on my team I'll get away
With murder: I'm like O.J., he's like my Cochran today
We keep the Mark Fuhrman tapes
In a safe, locked 'em away [*slam*]
Better watch what you say
Just when you thought you were safe
Them fuckers got you on tape
You swear to God you was playin'
Whether or not you was little Joshua
Gosh, I wish I could've told you to not do the same
'Cause one day it could cost you your name

And this was supposed to be my first single [*burp*]
But I just fucked that up, so
Fuck it, let's all have fun, let's mingle [*burp*]
Slap a bitch and smack a ho
This was supposed to be my catchy little jingle [*fart*]
That you hear on your radio
But shit's about to hit the shingle [*fart*]
Oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-no, erra
Oh, ah, erra, oh, ah, erra
Oh, ah, erra, oh-oh-ah-ah
Oh, ah, erra, oh, ah, erra
Oh, ah, erra, poo-poo-ka-ka

Eri-Eri-Erick swallowed some generic sleeping pills
And woke up in bed next to his best friend Derrick, bare-naked
Jig-a-jig-ji-ji-Janean just turned 16 and used a fake ID
To sneak in V.I.P. to see R. Kelly
Hee-hee-hee-hee-hee-hee to be so young and naïve
Oh what I wouldn't give to live so Kim and carefree
Paris and Nicky's parents must be so tickled, they cherish
Every picture with their kids with hickeys all over their necks
Hickory-dickory Dirk Diggler, look at me work wizardry
With these words – am I a jerk or just jerk chicken?
Or chiga-chigga-chig-chig-jer-chig-jer jerkin' your chain
Twenty-two jerks in a jerk circle, or is it a circle jerk?
Wait a minute, what am I sayin'? Allow me to run it back
And rewind it ...blblblblblblblb... – wait, let me ask you again
Am I just jerkin' your chain? Am I berserk or insane?
Or am I just one of them damn amateurs workin' the dang
Cameras, filmin' one of them Paris Hilton homemade
Pornos, who keeps tiltin' the lens at an angle
Jigga-ji-just recently somebody just discovered
Britney and Justin videotapes of 'em fuckin'
When they was just Mouseketeers in the Mickey Mouse Club
And dusted 'em and went straight to The Source with 'em
'Cause they could've sworn someone said, "Ni—"
And then tried to erase and record over it
But if you listen close enough to it you can hear the
"Ga-hu" and then they come to
Find out it was Justin sayin', "I'm gon—nuh cum!"

And this was supposed to be. my first single [*burp*]
But I just fucked that up, so
Fuck it, let's all have fun, let's mingle [*burp*]
Slap a bitch and smack a ho
This was supposed to be my catchy little jingle [*fart*]
That you hear on your radio
But shit's about to hit the shingle [*fart*]
Oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-no, erra
Oh, ah, erra, oh, ah, erra
Oh, ah, erra, oh-oh-ah-ah
Oh, ah, erra, oh, ah, erra
Oh, ah, erra, poo-poo-ka-ka

Any opinions or somethin' you just wanna get off your chest
And address it about my lyrics I'd love to hear it
All you gotta do is pick up the phone and just dial up this number
It's 1-800-I'M-A-DICK-SUCKER-I'D-LOVE-TO-SUCK-A-DICK
And if someone picks up
You can talk all the shit you want about me
Just type in your number back and follow it by the pound key
And I'll be sure to get back as soon as there comes a day
That I fall out with Dre, wake up gay and make up with Ray (hey!)
So fuck a chicken, lick a chicken, suck a chicken, beat a chicken
Eat a chicken like it's a big cock, big-a-big-cock!
Or suck a dick, and lick a dick, and eat a dick, and stick a dick in your mouth
I'm done, you can fuck off, fuck-a-fuck-off!

And this was supposed to be my first single [*burp*]
But I just fucked that up, so
Fuck it, let's all have fun, let's mingle [*burp*]
Slap a bitch and smack a ho
This was supposed to be my catchy little jingle [*fart*]
That you hear on your radio
But shit's about to hit the shingle [*fart*]
Oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-no, erra
Oh, ah, erra, oh, ah, erra
Oh, ah, erra, oh-oh-ah-ah
Oh, ah, erra, oh, ah, erra
Oh, ah, erra, poo-poo-ka-ka [*burp*]

You find me offensive, I find you offensive
For finding me offensive
Hence, if I should draw the line on any fences
If so to what extent
If at any should I go
'Cause it's getting expensive
Being on the other side of the courtroom on the defensive
They say I cause extensive
Psychological nerve damage to the brain when I go to lengths this
Far at other peoples' expenses
I say you're all just too goddamn sensitive
It's censorship
And it's downright blasphemous
Let's end this shit now 'cause I won't stand for this
And Christopher Reeves won't sit for this neither
And let's clear this up too I ain't got no beef with him either
He used to be like a hero to me
I even believe I had one of those 25 cent stickers on my refrigerator
Right next to Darth Vader
And Darth must have put a hex on him for later
I feel like it's my fault 'cause of the way that
I stuck him up in between him and Lex Luthor
I killed Superman, I killed Super-man
And how ironic, that I'd be the bad guy
Kryptonite: The Green Chronic

'Cause I ain't got no legs!
Or no brain, nice to meet you
Hi, my name is
I forgot my name!
My aim was not to become what I became with this level of fame
My soul is possessed by this devil my new name is
Rain Man

Now in the Bible it says
Thou shalt not watch two lesbians in bed
Have homosexual sex
Unless, of course, you were given the consent to join in
Then, of course, it's intercourse
And it's bi-sexual sex
Which isn't as bad, as long as you show some remorse for your actions
Either before, during or after performing the act of that which
Is normally referred to have such, more commonly known phrases
That are more used by today's kids
In a more derogatory way but
Who's to say, what's fair to say, and what not to say?
Let's ask Dr. Dre
Dr. Dre? (What up?)
I got a question if I may? (Yeah)
Is it gay to play putt-putt golf with a friend (Yeah)
And watch his butt-butt when he tees off? (Yeah)
But, but I ain't done yet
In football the quarterback yells out hutt-hutt
While he reaches in another grown man's ass
Grabs on his nuts but just what if
It was never meant it was just an accident
But he tripped, fell, slipped and his penis went in
His teeny tiny little round hiney and he didn't mean it
But his little weenie flinched just a little bit
And I don't need to go into any more details but
What if he pictured it as a female's butt?
Is that gay? I just need to clear things up
'Til then I'll just walk around with a manly strut because

'Cause I ain't got no legs!
Or no brain, nice to meet you
Hi, my name is
I forgot my name!
My aim was not to become what I became with this level of fame
My soul is possessed by this devil my new name is
Rain Man

You find me offensive, I find you offensive
Shit, this is the same verse I just did this
When am I gonna come to my good senses?
Probably the day Bush comes to my defenses
My spider sense is telling me Spiderman is nearby
And my plan is to get him next
And open up a whip-ass canister
Goddammit Dre where's the goddamn beat? (Yeah)
Anyway, anyway I don't know how else to put it
This is the only thing that I'm good at
I am the bad guy, Kryptonite: The Green Chronic
Demonic, yep yep, don't worry I'm on it
I got it, high five Nick Lachey
Stuck a pin in Jessica's head and walked away
And as she flew around the room like a balloon
I grabbed the last can of chicken tuna
Out the trash can and zoom
I headed straight back to the Neverland Ranch
With a peanut butter, jelly, chicken, tuna sandwich
And I ain't even gotta make no goddamn sense
I just did a whole song and I didn't say shit

'Cause I ain't got no legs!
Or no brain, nice to meet you
Hi, my name is
I forgot my name!
My aim was not to become what I became with this level of fame
My soul is possessed by this devil my new name is
Rain Man

Cause I
Yo, Rain Man
Definitely, definitely Dr. Dre super dope beat maker two thousand and
Two thousand four hundred and eighty seven million
Nine hundred and seventy three thousand four hundred and sixty three
And seventy (Yeah)

I don't understand
Why are you being so mean?
You're a mean mean man

You are just jealous of me
'Cause you, you just can't do what I do
So instead of just admitting it
You walk around and say
All kinds of really mean things
About me 'cause you're a meanie, a meanie
But it's only 'cause you're
Just really jealous of me
'Cause I'm what you want to be
So you just look like an idiot
When you say these mean things
'Cause it's too easy to see
You're really just a big weenie, big weenie

Alright listen, I need you to focus
I need you to go dig deep in your mind, this is important
We are going to perform an experiment of the sorts
I'm going to have to ask you to bear with me for a moment
Now I need you to open your mind-your eyes close them
You are now about to be placed under my hypnosis
For the next four and a half minutes
We are going to explore into your mind
To find out why you're so fuckin' jealous
Now why did they make Yoo-Hoo?
Pippity ga-ga poo-poo
Psych, I'm kidding
I just wanted to see if you're still listenin'
OK, now I need your undivided attention
Sir I have a question
Why do I always sense this undeniable tension
From the moment that I enter into the room
It gets all quiet and whispers
Whenever there's conversation, why am I always mentioned?
I've been dying to ask, it's been itchin' at me
Is it just because

You are just jealous of me
'Cause you, you just can't do what I do
So instead of just admitting it
You walk around and say
All kinds of really mean things
About me 'cause you're a meanie, a meanie
But it's only 'cause you're
Just really jealous of me
'Cause I'm what you want to be
So you just look like an idiot
When you say these mean things
'Cause it's too easy to see
You're really just a big weenie, big weenie

Alright now I (shit) I just flubbed a line
I was going to say something extremely important
But I forgot who or what it was, I fucked up
Psych, I'm kidding again you idiot, no I didn't
That's just what you wanted to hear from me
Is that I fucked up ain't it?
But I can bust one take without lookin' at no paper
It doesn't take a bunch of takes
Or me to stand here in this booth all day
For me to say the truth, OK?
You're drooling, you have tooth decay
Your mouth is open, you're disgusting
What the fuck you eat for lunch
A bunch of sweets or something, what?
You munch a bunch of Crunch 'N Munch?
Your tooth is rotten to the gum
Your breath stinks, wanna chew some gum?
Yes I do sir, what am I on?
You sir are on truth serum
Marshall I'm so jealous of you
Please say you won't tell nobody
I'd be so embarrassed, I'm just absolutely terrified
That someone's gonna find out why I'm saying
All these terrible, evil and awful mean things
It's my own insecurities!

You are just jealous of me
'Cause you, you just can't do what I do
So instead of just admitting it
You walk around and say
All kinds of really mean things
About me 'cause you're a meanie, a meanie
But it's only 'cause you're
Just really jealous of me
'Cause I'm what you want to be
So you just look like an idiot
When you say these mean things
'Cause it's too easy to see
You're really just a big weenie, big weenie

Alright now we, we're going to conduct
That experiment that we were talking about earlier
Just to see what a frog looks like when it takes two hits of ecstasy
'Cause that's exactly what your eyes look like, want to check to see?
Here's a mirror, notice the resemblance here?
Wait, let me put these sun glasses on
Now look in this mirror, how about now?
What do you have in common?
You're both green with envy and look like idiots with sunglasses on 'em
You look like I sound like singing about weenies
Now take my weenie out of your mouth
This is between me and you, I know you're not happy
I know you'd much rather see me lying in the corner of a room somewhere crying
Curled up in a ball tweaked out of my mind dying
There is no denying that my weenie is much bigger than yours is
Mine is like sticking a banana between two oranges
Why you even doing this to yourself, it's pointless
Why do we have to keep on going through this, this is torturous
My point is this
That if you say mean things, your weenie will shrink
Now I forgot what the chorus is, you're just a

You are just jealous of me
'Cause you, you just can't do what I do
So instead of just admitting it
You walk around and say
All kinds of really mean things
About me 'cause you're a meanie, a meanie
But it's only 'cause you're
Just really jealous of me
'Cause I'm what you want to be
So you just look like an idiot
When you say these mean things
'Cause it's too easy to see
You're really just a big weenie, big weenie

Fuck off my dick!

Down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down!
OK
Guess who's back?
Back again
Shady's back
Tell a friend
Whaaaaaaaa

Now everyone report to the dance floor
To the dance floor, to the dance floor
Now everyone report to the dance floor
Alright stop!.....Pajama time

Come here little kiddies, on my lap
Guess who's back with a brand new rap?
And I don't mean rap as in a new case of child molestation accusation
(AH-AH-AH-AH-AH)
No worries, papa's got a brand new bag of toys
What else could I possibly do to make noise?
I done touched on everything, but little boys
That's not a stab at Michael
That's just a metaphor, I'm just psycho
I go a little bit crazy sometimes
I get a little bit out of control with my rhymes
Good God, dip, do a little slide
Bend down, touch your toes and just glide
Up the center of the dance floor
Like TP for my bunghole
And it's cool if you let one go
Nobody's gonna know, who'd hear it?
Give a little "poot poot", it's OK! [*fart sound*]
Oops my CD just skipped
And everyone just heard you let one rip

Now I'm gonna make you dance
It's your chance
Yeah boy shake that ass

Well, it's Friday and it's my day
Just to party all the way to Sunday
Maybe 'til Monday, I don't know what day
Every day's just a holiday
Cruisin' on the freeway
Feelin' kinda breezy
Got the top down, lettin' my hair blow
I don't know where I'm goin'
All I know is when I get there
Someone's gonna touch my body

Excuse me miss, I don't mean to sound like a jerk
But I'm feelin' just a little stressed out from work
Could you punch me in the stomach and pull my hair?
Spit on me, maybe gouge my eyes out? (Yeah)
Now, what's your name girl?
What's your sign?
[Dr Dre] "Man, you must be up out your mind"

Oh baby, baby

Well, it's Tuesday and I'm locked up
I'm in jail and I don't know what happened
They say I was running butt naked
Down the street screaming
(AH-AH-AH-AH-AH)
Well I'm sorry, I don't remember
All I know is this much
I'm not guilty
They said, "Save it, boy we got you on tape
yellin' at an old lady to 'Touch my body!'"

Now this is the part where the rap breaks down
It gets real intense, no one makes a sound
Everything looks like it's 8 Mile now
The beat comes back and everybody lose themselves
Now snap back to reality
Look it's B.Rabbit!
Yo you signed me up to battle!?
I'm a grown man!
Chubba chubba chubba chubba chubba chubbie
I don't have any lines to go right here so, chubba teletubbie!
Fellas (WHAT?!) Fellas (WHAT?!)
Grab your left nut, make your right one jealous (what?)
Black girls
White girls
Skinny girls
Fat girls
Tall girls
Small girls
I'm callin' all girls

Everyone report to the dance floor

What the fuck is wrong with you?

If there's any bitches in this room, then there's something I gotta say
For all the fools who fell for the first girl who comes their way
I've been down that road and now I'm back, sittin' on square one
Tryna pick myself up where I started from

I never woulda thought that I'd see you outta control
Even though my penis was deep down in your hole
You should know between us we was like mates to soul
Nothing could intervene us, especially no hoes
You was more so the chalant type, I chose
To more shows, haunted you nights I suppose
That's how we go, with time spent, emotion grows
In the beginning, friends we decided to roll
So who's responsible when you get excited, explode
And Obie's grinning, then you invite that Obie's cold
But bitches they gon' talk, niggas they gon' hate
We established this way before we became mates
So what's required is that you chill with all that fire
Get your desire when I retire

Spend some time with me, say that you'll be mine
I never thought I'd find someone to be mine
Lord knows I was right 'cause you just crossed the line
Spend some time with me, say that you'll be mine

I used to say I never met a girl like you before
Still ain't got a fuckin' clue as to who you truly are
Almost went as far as introducing you to my daughters
'Til you went as far as goin' and snoopin' through my drawers
Now I just feel stupid for the loop that you threw me for
Can't believe I almost flew the coop for some stupid whore
You used to say all you wanted was for me to be yours
All I ever wanted from you was a few booty calls
If you recall I used to treat you like a groupie broad
When we fucked I refused to even take my jewelry off
But it threw me off the first time I called and you blew me off
It was a shock, it struck me as odd but it turned me on
You started getting moody on me, pretty soon we'd argue
And the ruder you got, the more beautiful you got to me
And who woulda even knew that who woulda even thought possibly
Cupid could shoot another one of them God damn darts at me
It's true that I got shot in the heart
But when someone seems too good to be true, they usually are
But see, when you're in it it's too hard to see
'Til you pull up and see some other dude's car parked and reach
Up under the seat as your heart starts to beat
Before you make a decision that's life altering
And just as you halt and you turn and you start to leave
You hear them words echoing, almost haunting, that taunting ring

Spend some time with me, say that you'll be mine
I never thought I'd find someone to be mine
Lord knows I was right 'cause you just crossed the line
Spend some time with me, say that you'll be mine

Ha, ha, yeah right, bitch
Spend some time on my dick

In most cases, Stat's attitude is fuck-a-bitch
My only motive is to get head and fuck a bitch
But you was different, thought we shared a covenant
Even held your hand in public, we sufferin' because of this
Shorty on some whole 'notha other shit
Tryna play slick thinkin' I'mma trick off grip
I'll admit, I was caught in the mix, down to commit
Feeding you the best of me, I shoulda fed you piss
We started off closer than close
But who coulda predicted to know, your triflin' ways woulda stopped our growth
And the final result, back in that same boat
I asked myself, do I love these hoes? No!

Em introduced us, "50 this is Tanya, Tanya this is 50"
Then slid off and left her to kick it with me
I complimented her, I said you have very nice lips
With my imagination, I could see her suckin' my dick
We played the phone game, a week later, shit changed fast
Had her comin' over in a cab to give me some ass
Downtown Manhattan on the balcony, stare at the skyline
Penthouse full of imported shit, you know how I grind
She got to talkin', talkin' like an opportunist too
Why talk when suckin' my dick is the real career move?
Said she's an inspiring actress, she do videos for practice
Yeah, yeah, know how many times I done heard that shit?

Spend some time with me, say that you'll be mine
I never thought I'd find someone to be mine
Lord knows I was right 'cause you just crossed the line
Spend some time with me, say that you'll be mine

Yeah
I know sometimes things may not always make sense to you right now
But hey, what daddy always tell you?
Straighten up little soldier
Stiffen up that upper lip
What you crying about?
You got me.

Hailie, I know you miss your mom, and I know you miss your dad
When I'm gone but I'm trying to give you the life that I never had
I can see you're sad, even when you smile, even when you laugh
I can see it in your eyes, deep inside you want to cry
'Cause you're scared, I ain't there?
Daddy's with you in your prayers
No more crying, wipe them tears
Daddy's here, no more nightmares
We gon' pull together through it, we gon' do it
Lainie Uncle's crazy, ain't he?
Yeah, but he loves you girl and you better know it
We're all we got in this world
When it spins, when it swirls
When it whirls, when it twirls
Two little beautiful girls
Lookin' puzzled, in a daze
I know it's confusing you
Daddy's always on the move, mamma's always on the news
I try to keep you sheltered from it but somehow it seems
The harder that I try to do that, the more it backfires on me
All the things growing up as daddy, that he had to see
Daddy don't want you to see but you see just as much as he did
We did not plan it to be this way, your mother and me
But things have got so bad between us
I don't see us ever being together ever again
Like we used to be when we was teenagers
But then of course everything always happens for a reason
I guess it was never meant to be
But it's just something we have no control over and that's what destiny is
But no more worries, rest your head and go to sleep
Maybe one day we'll wake up and this will all just be a dream

Now hush little baby, don't you cry
Everything's gonna be alright
Stiffen that upper lip up, little lady, I told ya
Daddy's here to hold ya through the night
I know mommy's not here right now and we don't know why
We fear how we feel inside
It may seem a little crazy, pretty baby
But I promise mama's gon' be alright

(Ha)
It's funny
I remember back one year when daddy had no money
Mommy wrapped the Christmas presents up
And stuck 'em under the tree and said some of 'em were from me
'Cause daddy couldn't buy 'em
I'll never forget that Christmas I sat up the whole night crying
'Cause daddy felt like a bum, see daddy had a job
But his job was to keep the food on the table for you and mom
And at the time every house that we lived in
Either kept getting broken into and robbed
Or shot up on the block and your mom was saving money for you in a jar
Tryna start a piggy bank for you so you could go to college
Almost had a thousand dollars 'til someone broke in and stole it
And I know it hurts so bad it broke your mamma's heart
And it seemed like everything was just startin' to fall apart
Mom and dad was arguin' a lot so momma moved back
On the Chalmers in the flat one bedroom apartment
And dad moved back to the other side of 8 Mile on Novara
And that's when daddy went to California with his CD and met Dr. Dre
And flew you and momma out to see me
But daddy had to work, you and momma had to leave me
Then you started seeing daddy on the T.V. and momma didn't like it
And you and Lainnie were too young to understand it
Papa was a rollin' stone, momma developed a habit
And it all happened too fast for either one of us to grab it
I'm just sorry you were there and had to witness it first hand
'Cause all I ever wanted to do was just make you proud
Now I'm sitting in this empty house, just reminiscing
Lookin' at your baby pictures, it just trips me out
To see how much you both have grown, it's almost like you're sisters now
Wow, I guess you pretty much are and daddy's still here
Lainnie I'm talkin' to you too, daddy's still here
I like the sound of that, yeah
It's got a ring to it don't it?
Shh, mama's only gone for the moment

Now hush little baby, don't you cry
Everything's gonna be alright
Stiffen that upper lip up, little lady, I told ya
Daddy's here to hold ya through the night
I know mommy's not here right now and we don't know why
We fear how we feel inside
It may seem a little crazy, pretty baby
But I promise mama's gon' be alright

And if you ask me to
Daddy's gonna buy you a mockingbird
I'mma give you the world
I'mma buy a diamond ring for you
I'mma sing for you
I'll do anything for you to see you smile
And if that mockingbird don't sing and that ring don't shine
I'mma break that birdie's neck
I'll go back to the jeweler who sold it to ya
And make him eat every carat don't fuck with dad (ha ha)

Tell myself that I was doing alright
There's nothing left to do tonight
But go crazy on you
Crazy on you
Let me go crazy, crazy on you

Can't you see what you do to me baby?
You make me crazy, you make me act like a maniac.
I'm like a lunatic, you make me sick
You're truly the only one who can do this to me
You just make me get so crazy.

I go schizo, I get so insane I just go schizophrenic
One minute I wanna slit your throat, the next I wanna sex
You make me crazy,
The way we act
Like two maniacs in the sack
We fuck like two jackrabbits
And maybe that's a bad habit.

'Cause the next day we're right back at it
In the same exact pattern
What the fuck is the matter with us?
We can't figure out if it's lust or it's love
What's that that's attracting us to each other?
They say that every man grows up to marry his own mother.

Which would explain why you're such a motherfucking bitch
But I stay and still stick it out with you even though I just hit you today
But you deserve it you hit me first and provoked me to choke you
Just 'cause I came home late last night crawled in bed and I woke you.

But if there's one thing about you that I admire it's, baby,
Because you stay with me, maybe, because you're as crazy as I am
'Cause when I look at you I can see an angel in your eyes
But if I look deeper inside I see your freakish little side.

Like a devil in disguise,
You're always full of surprises
Always pullin' devices
Out your purse: little vibrators and dildoes
You fucked yourself so much
You barely feel those anymore
You're only twenty-four but you're plenty more mature
Than those other little hoes
Who just act like little girls
Like they're in middle school still
You're crazy sexy cool,

Chilling you play your position
You never step out of line
Even though I stay in your business
You've always kept out of mine.

I wonder what's on your mind
Sometimes they say love is blind
Maybe that's why the first time I dotted your eye
You ain't see the sign.

Or maybe you did
Maybe you like being shoved
Maybe 'cause we're crazy in love

Crazy on you
Crazy on you
Let me go crazy crazy on you

You are the ink to my paper
What my pen is to my pad
The moral, the very fiber
The whole substance to my rap.

You are my reason for being
The meaning of my existence
If it wasn't for you
I would never be able to spit this
As intense as I do and the irony
Is you rely on me as much
As I rely on you to inspire me like you do.

You provide me the lighter fluid
You're fuel to my fire
You're my entire supply
Gas, the match and igniter.

The only way that I am able
To stay so stable
Is you're the legs to my table
If you were to break I'd fall on my face.

But I'm always gonna make you feel
I don't need you as much as I really need you
So you don't use it to your advantage.

But you're essential to me
You're the air I breathe
I believe if you ever leave me
I'd probably have no reason to be.

You are the Kim to my Marshall
You're the Slim to my Shady
The Dre to my Eminem
The Alaina to my Hailie.

You are the word that I'm looking for when
I'm trying to describe how I feel inside
And the right one just won't come to my mind.

You're like the pillar that props me up
The beam that supports me
The bitch who never took half,
The wife who never divorced me.

You're like the root to my evil
You let my devil come out me
You let me beat the shit out you
Before you beat the shit out me.

And no matter how much
Too much is never enough
Maybe 'cause we're crazy in love

Crazy on you
Crazy on you
Let me go crazy crazy on you

Once you call my name out, things will never be the same
They should've never let us get our foot in this game

Ever since I was introduced to rap music
I been missing a screw like Bishop in Juice, I could lose it
At any moment, those who know me know it
So they probably told to go with the flow just so that
I don't explode, and have another episode
Where I let it go as far as the one with Benzino did
I'm waiting for that next beef, I'm cocked, locked and loaded
I'm ready to go so bad
I'm going bananas, my dick's so hard Anna
Nicole could use it to fucking pole vault with
Oh shit! I mean when she was still bloated
Before they cut her stomach open and lypo'd it (Heheheh!)
Anybody I throw flames at gets a name
It's a game, 'cause they know that they don't spit the same
It's a shame what people do for 10 minutes of fame
Every day it's the same thing, people in this game
Try to buddy-buddy us
Just to get close enough to study us, everybody just wants
To have something to do with that
They all trying to get that stamp, they after that Shady/Aftermath money
It's like a monopoly
They probably just now finally understand "How to Rob" fully
50 Cent was like a fucking jackpot for me
And Dre, it's like we hit the fucking lottery
And the damn slot machine at the same time as each other
Why the fuck you think we ride like we brothers?
When we rhyme with each other, in time we discovered
That we had more in common than we thought with each other
Both robbed of our mothers, our fathers ain't want us
What was wrong with us, was it our fault?
'Cause we started thinking God doesn't love us
Two odd motherfuckers who just happened to meet at the right time
What a coincidence, 'cause when 50 got shot up in Jamaica
Queens, I still remember the call up at Chung King 'cause
Big L had just got popped just a month before
If 50 lives he's getting dropped from Columbia
Two years later, me and Doc had to come, and, uh-
Operate, that's when he popped up at number one
And we ain't never gonna stop if you wondering
Even if I'm under the gun
You ain't got to agree all the time with me or see eye-to-eye
There'll always be animosity between you and I
But see the difference is, if it is, I could give a shit
I'm still gonna conduct motherfucking business as usual
Egos aside 'fore I bruise 'em all
Swallow your pride 'fore I step on it with shoes you call
Nikes, Earthlings, how do you like these?
You gotta love 'em, look at the bottom of 'em, they're like cleats
Stomping, I been romping
Since Tim Dog was hollering "Fuck Compton"
I was whiling, freestyling
Back when they were still making Maxell cassettes
I wasn't even rap's Elvis yet, that tells us that
Any doubts in your head, that seals the shit
Ricky ticky toc, ticky ticky toc
Still with the Diggy Diggy Doc, Diggy Diggy Doc
And ya' don't stop

Ow, ow, ow (Oh, goddamn!)
I'm gonna facking cum! (Oh, shit!)
Fack, fack, fack (Fuck, I am!)
I am, I'm going to cum (I'm cumming!)

(Oh yeah, God!) I never seen no chick like this
This bitch can twist like a damn contortionist
Condom on my dick? Of course it is
This bitch don't know what abortion is
So I can't cum in her, fucks like a porn star
Looks like Jenna, fack, I'm gonna
Cum, I think my rubber's comin' off
But oh, it's so fucking wet and soft
Fuck, I'm gonna start lettin' off
I'm squirting and she's not gettin' off
And she's on top, I'm gonna facking
Oh, God, oh, don't do that
Don't, stop, stop, don't, I don't mean "don't stop"
Ow, wait a minute, ow, ow, fuck
I, I'm gonna fucking cum!

Ow, ow, ow (Oh, goddamn!)
I'm gonna fucking cum! (Oh, shit!)
Fack, fack, fack (Fuck, I am!)

(Oh, yeah, God!) Ooh, wow, boom that pow
Ooh, ow, I need a cigarette now
Ow, I'm so fucking hot
And you're so fucking hot
Oh my god, I wanna facking fack
No not "fuck", I said "fack"
F-A-C-K, F-A-C-K
Fack, fack, fack, facking freak me!
Oh yeah, girl see, baby, they call me Mr. Freaky
Let's call your sister, three-way
Have some threesome, me so horny
And you're such a fucking babe
I wanna go down on you—fuck, you shaved?!
Oh, goddamn, here I go again
I'm gonna cum, I am!

Ow, ow, ow (Oh, goddamn!)
I'm gonna facking cum! (Oh, shit!)
Fack, fack, fack (Fuck, I am!)
I am, I'm going to cum (I'm cumming!)

I'm Slim Shady, uh, uh, uh
I'm Slim Shady, uh, uh, uh
I'm Slim Shady, uh, uh, uh
I'm Slim Shady, uh, uh, uh

Okay, I'm done, I already came twice
You ain't gonna make me cum
I'm all outta gas, not so fast
Uh, your finger just went in my ass
Ow, that hurts, take it out now
Oh, wait a minute, aw
Put it back in, in-in-in
This don't mean I'm gay, I don't like men
I like boobs, boobs, boobs
Now see that gerbil, grab that tube
Shove it up my butt
Let that little rascal nibble on my asshole, uh
Yeah, right there, right there
Ah, I'm cumming, oh, yeah
Fack, I just came again
Okay, pull it out now, enhh
Oh, fuck yeah
Wait, he's not out, he's still crawling around up there
Ow, fuck, I think it's stuck
Ow, but it feels so fucking good

Ow, ow, ow (Oh, goddamn!)
I'm gonna facking cum! (Oh, shit!)
Fack, fack, fack (Fuck, I am!)
I am, I'm going to cum (I'm cumming!)

Shove a gerbil in your ass through a tube
Shove a gerbil in your ass through a tube
Shove a gerbil in your ass through a tube
Shove a gerbil in your ass through a tube
Ew, ew, ew, ew

Look, if you had one shot, or one opportunity
To seize everything you ever wanted, in one moment
Would you capture it, or just let it slip?

Yo! His palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy
There's vomit on his sweater already: Mom's spaghetti
He's nervous, but on the surface he looks calm and ready
To drop bombs, but he keeps on forgetting
What he wrote down, the whole crowd goes so loud
He opens his mouth, but the words won't come out
He's choking, how? Everybody's joking now
The clock's run out, time's up, over, blaow!
Snap back to reality, ope there goes gravity, ope
There goes Rabbit, he choked, he's so mad but he won't
Give up that easy, no, he won't have it, he knows
His whole back's to these ropes, it don't matter, he's dope
He knows that but he's broke, he's so stagnant, he knows
When he goes back to this mobile home, that's when it's
Back to the lab again yo, this whole rhapsody
Better go capture this moment and hope it don't pass him, and

You better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
You better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
You better…

His soul's escaping through this hole that is gaping
This world is mine for the taking, make me king
As we move toward a New World Order
A normal life is boring; but superstardom's
Close to post-mortem, it only grows harder
Homie grows hotter, he blows, it's all over
These hoes is all on him, coast-to-coast shows
He's known as the Globetrotter, lonely roads
God only knows, he's grown farther from home, he's no father
He goes home and barely knows his own daughter
But hold your nose, 'cause here goes the cold water
These hoes don't want him no mo', he's cold product
They moved on to the next schmoe who flows
He nose-dove and sold nada, and so the soap opera
Is told, it unfolds, I suppose it's old, partner
But the beat goes on: da da dum da dum da da da da

You better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
You better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
You better…

No more games, I'ma change what you call rage
Tear this motherfuckin' roof off like two dogs caged
I was playin' in the beginning, the mood all changed
I've been chewed up and spit out and booed off stage
But I kept rhymin' and stepped right in the next cypher
Best believe somebody's payin' the Pied Piper
All the pain inside amplified by the
Fact that I can't get by with my 9-to-5
And I can't provide the right type of life for my family
'Cause man, these goddamn food stamps don't buy diapers
And there's no movie, there's no Mekhi Phifer, this is my life
And these times are so hard, and it's gettin' even harder
Tryna feed and water my seed, plus teeter-totter
Caught up between bein' a father and a prima donna
Baby mama drama, screamin' on her, too much for me to wanna
Stay in one spot, another day of monotony's
Gotten me to the point I'm like a snail, I've got
To formulate a plot or end up in jail or shot
Success is my only motherfuckin' option, failure's not
Mom, I love you, but this trailer's got
To go; I cannot grow old in Salem's Lot
So here I go, it's my shot: feet, fail me not
This may be the only opportunity that I got

You better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (go)
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
You better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (go)
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
You better…

You can do anything you set your mind to, man

Yeah...
It's my life...
In my own words I guess...

Have you ever loved someone so much, you'd give an arm for?
Not the expression, no, literally give an arm for?
When they know they're your heart
And you know you were their armour
And you will destroy anyone who would try to harm her
But what happens when karma turns right around and bites you?
And everything you stand for turns on you to spite you?
What happens when you become the main source of her pain?
"Daddy, look what I made", Dad's gotta go catch a plane
"Daddy, where's Mommy? I can't find Mommy where is she?"
I don't know go play, Hailie, baby, your Daddy's busy
Daddy's writing a song, this song ain't gon' write itself
I'll give you one underdog and you gotta swing by yourself
Then turn right around on that song and tell her you love her
And put hands on her mother, who's a spitting image of her
That's Slim Shady, yeah, baby, Slim Shady's crazy
Shady made me, but tonight Shady's rock-a-by baby...

And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that I'm looking down on you smiling
And I didn't feel a thing,
So, baby, don't feel no pain
Just smile back
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that I'm looking down on you smiling
And I didn't feel a thing,
So, baby, don't feel no pain
Just smile back...

I keep having this dream, I'm pushin' Hailie on the swing
She keeps screaming, she don't want me to sing
"You're making Mommy cry, why? Why is Mommy crying?"
Baby, Daddy ain't leaving no more. "Daddy, you're lying.
You always say that, you always say this is the last time
But you ain't leaving no more, Daddy, you're mine."
She's piling boxes in front of the door tryna block it
"Daddy, please, Daddy, don't leave, Daddy, no, stop it!"
Goes in her pocket, pulls out a tiny necklace locket
It's got a picture, "This'll keep you safe, Daddy, take it with you."
I look up, it's just me standing in the mirror
These fucking walls must be talking, 'cause man I can hear 'em
They're saying, "You've got one more chance to do right, and it's tonight.
Now go out there and show 'em that you love 'em 'fore it's too late."
And just as I go to walk out of my bedroom door
It turns to a stage, they're gone, and this spotlight is on
And I'm singing...

And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that I'm looking down on you smiling
And I didn't feel a thing,
So, baby, don't feel no pain
Just smile back
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that I'm looking down on you smiling
And I didn't feel a thing,
So, baby, don't feel no pain
Just smile back...

Sixty thousand people, all jumping out their seat
The curtain closes, they're throwing roses at my feet
I take a bow and thank you all for coming out
They're screaming so loud, I take one last look at the crowd
I glance down, I don't believe what I'm seeing
"Daddy, it's me, help Mommy, her wrists are bleeding."
But, baby, we're in Sweden, how did you get to Sweden?
"I followed you, Daddy, you told me that you weren't leavin'.
"You lied to me, Dad, and now you made Mommy sad.
And I bought you this coin, it says 'Number One Dad'.
That's all I wanted, I just wanna give you this coin.
I get the point. Fine. Me and Mommy are going."
But, baby, wait.
"It's too late, Dad, you made your choice.
Now go up there and show 'em that you love 'em more than us."
That's what they want, they want you Marshall
They keep screamin' your name
It's no wonder you can't go to sleep, just take another pill
Yeah, I bet you you will. You rap about it, yeah, word, k-keep it real
I hear applause, all this time I couldn't see
How could it be, that the curtain is closing on me?
I turn around, find a gun on the ground, cock it
Put it to my brain, scream, "Die Shady!" and pop it
The sky darkens, my life flashes,
The plane that I was supposed to be on crashes
And burns to ashes
That's when I wake up, alarm clock's ringin', there's birds singin'
It's spring and Hailie's outside swinging,
I walk right up to Kim and kiss her
Tell her I miss her,
Hailie just smiles and winks at her little sister
Almost as if to say

And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that I'm looking down on you smiling
And I didn't feel a thing,
So, baby, don't feel no pain
Just smile back
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that I'm looking down on you smiling
And I didn't feel a thing,
So, baby, don't feel no pain
Just smile back...

Boom boom chuck, boom b-boom chuck
Boom boom chuck, boom b-boom chuck
Boom boom chuck, boom b-boom chuck
Boom boom chuck, boom b-boom chuck
We should do something like that, yeah (Yeah!)

Boom boom chuck, boom b-boom chuck! (Ha ha)
Boom boom chuck, yeah, that's what's up! (Woo!)
Boom boom chuck, boom b-boom chuck!
Boom boom chuck, b-boom—Shady!

There's never been this, much of a menace in this game as this
And it's the, most sinister duo in the business
Once again it's the... illest and realest killers
The most villainous, Dre protege, Shady apprentice
Drop them zeros and get with these heroes
Do you want losers or winners? This music is in us, and it's
Not over 'til we say it's finished
And G-Unit spinners will keep spinning
This is hip-hop when it's in it's
Truest form, the greatest, hate us or love us
Make voodoo dolls of us and keep sticking them pins in us
Thick as his skin is or as short as his wick is
The trick is to be able to walk big as his dick is
And as sick as his music is, or was, still is
Whatever, forever, he will be the illest
To ever sh-shock the world, what to do next?
He's already reconciled with his ex
A chainsaw and an axe
Choke a bitch to death, strangle her neck
While we have sex, while Bill Clinton plays the sax
I sprays the facts, yeah, bring Shady on back
The maniac of rap, devil baby on crack
Resurrect? I never left, baby, I'm bad
I've gone mad, my comrade Dre-zie automatically
Says I'm too broke to fix, way beyond that
I may be off drugs, but it's made me off-track
In fact, this right here very well could be the last rap
I ever do spit, I'll never do shit, that's that
Fuck it, I quit, suck on a dick, jackass
I'm done with this wack-ass rap, kiss my black ass!

Hello, what up? Hello?
Yo, I can't, I can't hear you
Let me call you right back

I sense someone's tappin' into my phones, why do
I got this feeling in my bones I might die soon?
The FBI might be tryin' to pull my file soon
I might be walkin' blindfold into a typhoon
I might be seein' rockets light up the night sky
Right outside of the window of my living room
And if they do, you can say good night
And bye-bye to them iTunes
If I don't try to record as much before I do
The plan is to have as many in the can as I can
As I stand before you in this booth a walking dead man
Blank stare, dead pan, look on my face
As I gaze into space, as I wait to be scooped up in that van
As I mysteriously disappear into thin air
And they gonna say a sniper just appeared outta nowhere
And I'll go down in the history as the bloodsuckin' leech
Who hid behind the freedom of speech
Tried to take the 5th Amendment, use it, twist it and bend it
And ended up dyin' the villain, not the hero, splendid
Stupendous way to end this
I can feel the tremors tremendous
In remembrance of September 11th
Flashback to September 7th
When 2Pac was murdered in Vegas
He said it, he predicted his own death, let us never forget it
Should we ever live to regret it
Like the day John F. Kennedy was assassinated in broad day
By the crazed lunatic with a gun
Who just happened to work on the same block
In the library book depository
Where the President would go for a little Friday stroll
Shots fired from the grassy knoll
But they don't know, or do they?
Who's they for them to say "touché"?
We're all vulnerable and it's spook-ay
This is about as kook-ay as I've ever felt now
Count down to nuclear meltdown
Seven, six, five, four, three, two, one
You can run, you can do what you want to
But you know you ain't gonna do nothin'
When it's time, it's your time, you are the prime target
You have become Public Enemy number one

In my mind, I'm a fighter, my heart's a lighter
My soul is the fluid, my flow sparks it right up
An arsenic writer, author with arth-r-itis
Carpal tunnel, Marshall with Start-Shit-Itis
Hardheaded and hotheaded, bullheaded and pigheaded
Dick-headed, a prick, a big headache
I'm sick, quick-witted; for every lyric spitted
There are six critics who wait for me to slip with it
So, quick—this dynamite stick, bury the wick
It's gonna explode any minute
Some lunatic lit it
And it's not Nelly, do not tell me to stop yelling
When I stop selling, I'll quit, so stop dwelling!
I am not failing, you fuckers are not ready
'Cause I got jelly, like Beyoncé's potbelly
This is destiny; yes, money, I'm off running
So get off of me, I'm not slowing or softening

No apologies! Nah, suckers, I'm not sorry
You can all sue me, y'all could be the cause of me
No apologies! Y'all feeling the force of me
No remorse for me, like there was no recourse for me
Nah, no apologies! Not even acknowledging you at all
'Til I get a call that God's coming
No apologies! Laugh, fuckers, it's all funny
I can spit in your face while you're standing across from me
No apologies!

My head hits the pillow, a weeping willow
I can't sleep, a pain so deep, it bellows
But these cellos help just to keep me mellow
Hands on my head, touch knees to elbows
I'm hunched over, emotion just flows over
These cold shoulders are both frozen, you don't know me
I keep saying it, I can't stress it enough
So keep playing it, and stand next to the subs
I choke mics like asphyxiation
When I'm strangling my own throat masturbating, haha!
Fuck, yeah, I'm a basket case
And I'll master this rap shit 'til my ass gets wasted
'Til my assassination
'Til I'm slain because of some fag's infatuation
.44 mag's a fascination
A taste for disaster, and if that's the case, then—

No apologies! Nah, suckers, I'm not sorry
You can all sue me, y'all could be the cause of me
No apologies! Y'all feeling the force of me
No remorse for me, like there was no recourse for me
Nah, no apologies! Not even acknowledging you at all
'Til I get a call that God's coming
No apologies! Laugh, fuckers, it's all funny
I can spit in your face while you're standing across from me
No apologies!

This song isn't for you, it's for me
A true MC, it's what he'll do just to see
If he still has it and if his skills mastered
He's able to spill raps long after he's killed, that's a—
Real MC, got you feelin' me
Whether willing or unwillingly, you still agree
As long as there's still this hunger and will in me
Then expect a longer life expectancy
I'd be a savage beast if I ain't had this
Outlet to salvage me inside
I'd be exploding, soaked in self-loathing
And mourning, so I'm warning you: don't coax me
It's silly, I'm really a sheep in wolf's clothing
Who only reacts when he gets pushed, don't be—
Fooled; the press blows up this whole thing
It's stupid, they don't know, 'cause they don't see
That I'm wounded, all they did was ballooned it
I'm sick of talking 'bout these tattoos Cartoon did
That's why I tuned it out, I'm sick of duking
They can suck my dick while I'm puking
And you, too, you can—

Expect no sympathy from me
I'm an MC, this is how I'm supposed to be
Cold as a G, my heart's frozen
It don't even beat, so expect no apologies
Expect no sympathy from me
I'm an MC, this is how I'm supposed to be
Cold as a G, my heart's frozen
It don't even beat, so expect no apologies

Oh oh oh oh oh ooh

There is no escaping
There's no place to hide
You scream, "Someone save me!"
But they don't pay no mind
But they don't pay no mind
Goodnight, goodbye!

You're walkin' down a horror corridor
It's almost 4 in the morning and you're in a
Nightmare, it's horrible
Right there's the coroner
Waiting for ya to turn the corner so he can corner ya
You're a goner he's onto ya
Out the corner of his cornea he just saw you run
All you want is to rest 'cause you can't run anymore you're done
All he wants is to kill you in front of an audience
While everybody is watching in the party applauding it

Here I sit while I'm caught up in deep thought again
Contemplating my next plot again
Swallowing a Klonopin while I'm nodding in and out on the ottoman
At the Ramada Inn, holdin' on to the pill bottle then
Lick my finger and swirl it round the bottom and make sure I got all of it

Wake up naked at McDonald's with
Blood all over me, Dead bodies behind the counter, shit
Guess I must have just blacked out again
Not again!

It's 3 A.M. in the mornin'
Put my key in the door and
Bodies layin' all over the floor and
I don't remember how they got there
But I guess I must've killed 'em (killed 'em)
I said
It's 3 A.M. in the mornin'
Put my key in the door and
Bodies layin' all over the floor and
I don't remember how they got there
But I guess I must've killed 'em (killed 'em)

Sitting nude in my living room
It's almost noon
I wonder what's on the tube
Maybe they'll show some boobs
Surfin' every channel until I find Hannah Montana
Then I reach for the aloe and lanolin
Bust all over the wall paneling
Dismantlin' every candle
On top of the fireplace mantel and
Grab my flannel and my bandanna then
Kiss the naked mannequin man again
You can see him standin' in my front window if you look in

I'm just a hooligan who's used to usin' hallucinogens
Causin' illusions again
Brain contusions again
Cutting and bruisin' the skin
Razors, scissors and pins
Jesus, when does it end?
Phases, that I go through
Dazed and I'm so confused
Days that I don't know who
Gave these molecules to
Me. What am I gon' do?
Hey the prodigal son
The diabolical one
Very methodical when I slaughter them

It's 3 A.M. in the mornin'
Put my key in the door and
Bodies layin' all over the floor and
I don't remember how they got there
But I guess I must've killed 'em (killed 'em)
I said
It's 3 A.M. in the mornin'
Put my key in the door and
Bodies layin' all over the floor and
I don't remember how they got there
But I guess I must've killed 'em (killed 'em)

She puts the lotion in the bucket, it puts the lotion on the skin
Or else it gets the hose again
She puts the lotion in the bucket, it puts the lotion on the skin
Or else it gets the hose again

I cut and I slash slice and gash
Last night was a blast
I can't quite remember when I had that
Much fun off a half pint of the Jack
My last Vic and a half
A flashlight up Kim Kardashian's ass

I remember the first time I dismembered a family member
December I think it was, I was havin' drinks with my cousin
I wrapped him in Christmas lights, pushed him into the stinkin' tub
Cut him up into pieces and just when I went to drink his blood
I thought, "I oughta drink his bath water that oughta be fun."
That's when my days of serial murder manslaughter begun
The sight of blood excites me, that might be an artery son
Your blood curdling screams just don't seem to bother me none
It's 3 A.M. and here I come so you should probably run
A secret passageway around here man there's got to be one
Oh no there's probably none
He can scream all that he wants
Top of his lungs, but ain't no stoppin' me from choppin' him up... up
'Cause it's

3 A.M. in the mornin'
Put my key in the door and
Bodies layin' all over the floor and
I don't remember how they got there
But I guess I must've killed 'em (killed 'em)
I said
It's 3 A.M. in the mornin'
Put my key in the door and
Bodies layin' all over the floor and
I don't remember how they got there
But I guess I must've killed 'em (killed 'em)

Yo, yo, ayo (Evil rise)
Yo, yo, ayo (Evil rise)
Yo, yo, ayo (Evil rise)
Yo, yo, ayo (Evil rise)
(Evil rise)
(Evil rise)

Yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Okay
Alright, aight, aight, aight, aight, aight
Yo, yo
Alright, I'mma lay the chorus first
Here we go now

My mom loved Valium and lots of drugs
That's why I am like I am 'cause I'm like her
Because my mom loved Valium and lots of drugs
That's why I'm on what I'm on 'cause I'm my mom

My mom, my mom
I know you're probably tired of hearing 'bout my mom
Oh-ho, whoa-ho
But this is just a story of when I was just a shorty
And how I became hooked on Va-aliu-um
Valium was in everything, food that I ate
The water that I drank, fuckin' peas on my plate
She sprinkled just enough of it to season my steak
So every day, I'd have at least three stomach aches
Now, tell me, what kind of mother would want to see her
Son grow up to be an under-a-fuckin'-chiever?
My teacher didn't think I was gonna be nothin' either
"What the fuck you stickin' gum up under the fucking seat for?"
"Mrs. Mathers, your son has been huffing ether
Either that or the motherfucker's been puffin' reefer"
But all this huffin' and puffin' wasn't what it was either
It was neither, I was buzzing but it wasn't what she thought
Pee in a teacup? Bitch, you ain't my keeper, I'm sleeping
What the fuck you keep on fucking with me for?
Slut, you need to leave me the fuck alone, I ain't playin'
Go find you a white crayon and color a fucking zebra

My mom loved Valium and lots of drugs
That's why I am like I am 'cause I'm like her
Because my mom loved Valium and lots of drugs
That's why I'm on what I'm on 'cause I'm my mom

Wait a minute, this ain't dinner, this is paint thinner
"You ate it yesterday, I ain't hear no complaints, did I?
Now here's a plate full of painkillers
Now just wait 'til I crush the Valium and put it in your potatoes
You little motherfucker, I'll make you sit there and make
That retarded fucking face without even tasting it
You better lick the fucking plate, you ain't wasting it
Put your face in it 'fore I throw you in the basement again
And I ain't givin' in, you're gonna just sit there
In one fucking place, finnickin' 'til next Thanksgiving
And if you still ain't finished it, I'll use the same shit again
Then when I make spinach dip, it'll be placed in the shit
You little shit, wanna sit there and play innocent?
A rack fell and hit me in K-Mart and they witnessed it
Child support, your father, he ain't sent the shit
And so what if he did? It's none of your dang business, kid"

My mom
There's no one else quite like my mom
I know I should let bygones be bygones
But she's the reason why I am high what I'm high on

'Cause my mom loved Valium and lots of drugs
That's why I am like I am 'cause I'm like her
Because my mom loved Valium and lots of drugs
That's why I'm on what I'm on 'cause I'm my mom

My mom loved Valium, now all I am
Is a party animal, I am what I am
But I'm strong to the finish with me Valium spinach
But my buzz only lasts about two minutes
But I don't wanna swallow it without chewin' it
I can't even write a rhyme without you in it
My Valium, my Vaaaaaa-liummmm, ohh

Man, I never thought that I could ever be
A drug addict, naw, fuck that, I can't have it happen to me
But that's actually
What has ended up happening, a tragedy
The fucking past ended up catching me
And it's probably where I got acquainted with the taste, ain't it?
Pharmaceuticals are the bomb, Mom, beautiful
She killed the fuckin' dog with the medicine she done fed it
Feed it a fuckin' aspirin and say that it has a headache
"Here, want a snack? You hungry, you fuckin' brat?
Look at that, it's a Xanax, take it and take a nap, eat it"
But I don't need it "Well fuck it then, break it up
Take a little piece and beat it before you wake Nathan up"
Alright Ma, you win, I don't feel like arguin'
I'll do it, pop and gobble it and start wobblin'
Stumble, hobble, tumble, slip, trip then I fall in bed
With a bottle of meds and a Heath Ledger bobblehead

My mom loved Valium and lots of drugs
That's why I am like I am 'cause I'm like her
Because my mom loved Valium and lots of drugs
That's why I'm on what I'm on 'cause I'm my mom

My mom, I'm just like her
My mom, my mom, my mom
My mom, my mom, my mom
My mom, my mom, my mom
My mom, my momma
Me momma, I like-a da momma
Haha, sorry Mom
I still love you though
Dr. Dre, 2010
Ay, this shit is hella hard, homie
Yo, take us on outta here
Woo!

I was born with a dick in my brain, yeah fucked in the head
My stepfather said that I sucked in the bed
'Til one night he snuck in and said
We're going out back, I want my dick sucked in the shed
Can't we just play with Teddy Ruxpin instead?
After I fuck you in the butt, get some head
Bust a nut, get some rest
The next day my mother said "I don't know what the fuck's up with this kid!
The bastard won't even eat nothing he's fed
He just hung himself in the bedroom he's dead"
"Debbie don't let that fucker get you upset
Go in there, stick a fuckin' cigarette to his neck I bet you he's fakin' it
I bet you I bet he probably just wants to see how upset you would get I'll go handle this of course, unless you object"
"Ah go fuck his brains out, if any's left in his head"

If you could count the skeletons in my closet
Under my bed and up under my faucet
Then you would know I've completely lost it
Is he nuts? No! He's insane!
If you could count the skeletons in my closet
Under my bed and up under my faucet
Then you would know I've completely lost it
Is he nuts? No! He's insane!

"Did you get him?" Naaw, fucker tried to bite my face off I just got fuckin' chased off with a chainsaw!
Then he took the chainsaw, bit the fuckin' blades off
Ate the blades, stuck a baseball in a slingshot
Then he aimed at his own face, let the thing pop
Took his eye out, picked it up and played ping pong
Then he played ping pong with his own ding dong!
That motherfucker's got nuts like King Kong
Then he set the lawn mower out on the dang lawn
And he laid all up underneath it with the thing on
Then he took his pants, he took every fuckin' thing off
Everything, except his tank top and his training bra
Ain't he raw? Yeah maniac, that's Shady dog
Man that motherfucker's gangsta, ain't he dog?
Shady dog, what be going through that fuckin' brain of yours
Say no more, what the fuck you waitin' for, sing along

If you could count the skeletons in my closet
Under my bed and up under my faucet
Then you would know I've completely lost it
Is he nuts? No! He's insane!
If you could count the skeletons in my closet
Under my bed and up under my faucet
Then you would know I've completely lost it
Is he nuts? No! He's insane!

Don't you know what felch means? (yeah), well then tell me
Would you rather get felched or do the felching?
Fuck him in the ass, suck the cum out while you're belching
Burp, belch, then go back for a second helping
Can you dig what I'm sayin' man, can you smell me?
I want you to feel me like my stepfather felt me (oohh)
Fuck a little puppy, kick the puppy while he's yelping "Shady what the fuck you saying!?"
I don't know help me! What the fuck's happening, I think I'm fucking melting
"Marshall I just love you boy, I care about your well being"
No Dad, I said no
I don't need no help peeing I'm a big boy, I can do it by myself see!
I only get naked when the babysitter tells me
She showed me a movie like "Nightmare on Elm Street"
But it was X, and they called it "Pubic Hair on Chelsea"
"Well this is called ass rape, and we're shooting the jail scene"

If you could count the skeletons in my closet
Under my bed and up under my faucet
Then you would know I've completely lost it
Is he nuts? No! He's insane!
If you could count the skeletons in my closet
Under my bed and up under my faucet
Then you would know I've completely lost it
Is he nuts? No! He's insane!

Oh, it's music to my ears, oh man
How can I describe the way I feel?
Fucking great, man
Okay, let me see
How could I begin?

Locked in Mariah's wine cellar, all I had for lunch
Was bread, wine, more bread, wine and Captain Crunch
Red wine for breakfast and for brunch
And to soak it up, an in-between snack, crackers to munch
Mariah, whatever happened to us?
Why did we have to break up?
All I asked for was a glass of punch
You see, I never really asked for much
I can't imagine what's going through your mind after such
A nasty break-up with that Latin hunk
Luis Miguel, Nick Cannon better back the fuck up
I'm not playin', I want her back, you punk
This is Hello Kitty bedspread, Satin Funk
Mixed with Egyptian, with a little rap and punk
Zapp and Eric Clapton, Shaft, Frank Zappa, crunk
And yeah baby, I want another crack at ya
You can beat me with any spatula that you want
I mean, I really want you bad, you cunt
Nick, you had your fun, I've come to kick you in your sack of junk
Man, I could use a fresh batch of blood
So prepare your vernacular for Dracula acupuncture

Bagpipes from Baghdad
When will it ever cease?
For Pete's sake, he's crazy to say the least
Bagpipes from Baghdad
What's going through my mind
Half the time, when I rhyme, or blowing up like
Bagpipes from Baghdad
Somebody turn the vacancy sign on
'Cause I'm gone, blowing on my
Bagpipes from Baghdad
I run the streets and act like a madman holding a Glad—

You can be a permanent fixture in my lyrical mixture
I'm the Miracle Whip trickster
My signature sound, when a tube of lipstick's around
I'm bound to put it on in an instant, wow
Man, what an ensemble!
What an assortment of pharma–ceuticals
This beautiful pill dust in my palm, my
Cuticles get residue just from touchin' the bottle
Never knew I could remind me so much of my momma
I'll cut ya like Dahmer, pull a butcher knife on ya
The size of a sword, boy, I'm like the fuckin' Red Sonja
Get it stuck in your cornea, nice knowing ya, Norman
You're so fuckin' annoyin', drop the shovel, boy
You don't know what the fuck you're doin'
I ain't playin' no fuckin' more
Nick Cannon, you prick, I wish you luck with the fuckin' whore
Every minute there's a sucker born, snuck up on Malachai
Made the motherfucker suck on a shuck of corn
Shuck o', shuck o' corn, Chaka Khan
Hit Jason in the face with a hockey puck, and
Told him it's fuckin' on, man, what the fuck are ya doin'?
You're runnin' over the snowblower with the lawnmower
Blowin' your bagpipes from Baghdad

Bagpipes from Baghdad

Bagpipes from Baghdad
I run the streets and act like a madman holding a Glad bag

In the bed with two brain-dead lesbian vegetables
I bet you they become heterosexual
Nothing will stop me from molestin' you
Titty-fuckin' you 'til your breast nipple flesh tickles my testicles
Is what I said to the two conjoined twins
How's it going, girlfriends? You needs a boyfriend?
You need some ointment? Just set up an appointment
Who's gonna see the doctor first? We'll do a coin flip
I just got my one-year sobriety coin chip
When the bad get going, how bad does the going get?
Baby, you shouldn't have any trouble rubbing groins with
Each other, especially when you're joined at the hip
I'm going to get the needle and thread from the sewing kit
And attempt to separate 'em and stitch 'em back at the loin, shit
Lure the little boy with the chocolate 'Chips Ahoy!' chip
Cookie, lookie, even took me a Polaroid pic

Hello
Allow me to introduce myself
My name is Shady
It's so nice to meet you
It's been a long time
I'm sorry I've been away so long
My name is Shady
I never meant to leave you

You see that chick in the gym checking me out?
Any second I'm 'bout
To stick her neck in my mouth
I lose a pill and I'm recklessly wrecking the house
That was supposed to be breakfast, where the heck is it now?

There's the necklace I lost, right next to Stephanie's blouse
Man I should check to see if my mom left any out
Nope, guess I'll re-route
Maybe somewhere in the depths of the couch
Oh! Jackpot! Yeah, 'Open Sesame' mouth

Down the hatch and the feeling you can't match it
I rap-tap-tap on your door with a damn ratchet
Attack-tack-tacking a whore with a damn hatchet
A knapsack packed with like 40-some Xanaxes

Shorty come back, I'm tryna score me some lapdances
I'm bout to relapse so baby pour me some Jack Daniel's
Formula 40-40 and 40s with bad capsules
The bad apple spoils the bunch I'm back at you

Girl I don't mean any harm all I wanted to do is just say "hello"
And are you menstruating baby, my little friend's waiting to say "hello"
The way your titties are wiggling and your booty's shaking like Jello
Girl I don't mean any harm all I wanted to do is just say "hello"

My equilibrium's off, must be the lithium
I don't need to buy any drugs, man people give me 'em
It just becomes everyday extra-curriculum
No reason in particular, it was strictly fun

A fifth of rum and two bottles of 151
51 people asleep in my damn living room
Excuse me hun? But what is your name? Vivian?
I woke up next to you naked and uh, did we umm?

Of course we did, but didn't I strap Jimmy hun?
I'm looking for the torn wrapper but there don't seem to be one
No offense baby girl I don't mean any harm
But disease is something I'm trying to keep my penis free from

I find the package and I'm cool,
I immediately run
Like Speedy Gonzalez to see if I see anyone
Who might have a couple of threes,
I'm fiending for some
My head is pounding to the beat of the drum

Girl I don't mean any harm all I wanted to do is just say "hello"
And do you happen to have anything on you to make my mood mellow?
Some are oval, and some are pink, some are blue and some are just yellow
Girl I don't mean any harm all I wanted to do is just say "hello"

Oh, those were the days, they certainly were
It's hurting me to know that I'll be closing that curtain for good
Word-word, chi-word-word, chi-word-chi-chi-word
I second that and I third,
Rush to emergency surgery
To try to flush me because of the drugs that he purchased

He's no longer getting them free
Hundred bucks for these Percodans
Plus it's getting to be where he lustfully search the den
Pain is hitting his knee and his muscles be hurting him

Tirelessly on the phone tryna rustle up muscle relaxers
For his back and a couple of Paxils
Now he's doubling backwards and he's stumbling back
Slipped and fell, hit his back, boom, heard something go crack

Now he's up in the bathroom like he's busting a nap
Almost ended it that soon because of the fact
I'm just busting my own chops while I'm busting a rap
Resuscitated and rejuved so fuck it, I'm back

Girl I don't mean any harm all I wanted to do is just say "hello"
And do you happen to have anything on you to make my mood mellow,
Some are oval, and some are pink, some are blue and some are just yellow
Girl I don't mean any harm all I wanted to do is just say "hello"

And so I'm saying,

Hello allow me to introduce myself
My name is Shady
So nice to meet you
It's been a long time
I'm sorry I've been away so long
My name is Shady
I never meant to leave you

It's like starting over
Clean slate

Yo
Same song and dance
Damn girl, everywhere I go
Same song and dance
I like the way you move, all over the globe
Same song and dance
Something about it, man
Same song and dance
In the pale moonlight
Yo

I'm looking at ya, yeah girl, you're kinda tooken back by
The whole rapper thing, aren't ya?
Probably thinking you'll get slapped so dang hard, ya
Won't even be able to stand up straight, aren't ya?
Couple rape charges, people think you're a monster
The police constantly bugging you, non-stop
I walk up on ya, "Well, hello Tonya"
I think you got your OnStar button inside your car stuck
You out of gas? Do you got a flat?
I would hate for you to be stranded at the laundromat
I got your back
Why don't you put your laundry baskets in the back
And sit up front; I'm not asking, it's a trap
You just got jacked and body snatched, and it's a wrap
In broad day, and no mask for this attack
I heard 'em say exact opposites attract
If that's a fact, it'll take task force to get you back
C'mon

Yeah baby, do that dance
It's the last dance you'll ever get the chance to do
Girl, shake that ass, you ain't never gonna break that glass
That windshield's too strong for you
I said, yeah baby, sing that song
It's the last song you'll ever get the chance to sing
You sexy little thing, show me what you got, give it your all
Look at you bawl, why you crying to me?
Same song and dance

The first victim I had, she was a big one
Big movie star, a party girl, big fun
She was the girl the media always picked on
In and out of rehab every 4 to 6 months
She was always known for little pranks and slick stunts
At Nickelodeon, flashed the little kids once
What an event it was, I was sitting in front
I was hooked in at the first glimpse of them buns
Seen her backstage, now here's where I come in, son
Look, here she comes, I better pull out the big guns
Hello Lindsay, you're looking a little thin, hun
How 'bout a ride to rehab? Get in, cunt
But starting off on the wrong foot is what I didn't want
Girl, I'm just kidding, let me start over again, hun
See what I meant was, we should have a little intervention
Come with me to Brighton, let me relieve your tension
You little wench, ya, murder wasn't my intention
If I wanted to kill you, it would've already been done
Slowly she gets in and I begin to lynch her
With 66 inches of extension cord

Yeah baby, do that dance
It's the last dance you'll ever get the chance to do
Girl, shake that ass, you ain't never gonna break that glass
That windshield's too strong for you
I said, yeah baby, sing that song
It's the last song you'll ever get the chance to sing
You sexy little thing, show me what you got, give it your all
Look at you bawl, why you crying to me?
Same song and dance

My second victim was even bigger than the first
Pop star, icon, the whole works
She played a little schoolgirl when she first
Burst upon the scene and seen that the world was hers
She twirls and turns and flirts in skirts so bad it hurts
It irked me, it made me mad at first
I lashed out in my songs, but what was really going on
Was that I had developed a crush
I just didn't know how to tell it to her
Should I cut off one of my ears and mail it to her?
Send her pictures of my collection of skeletons, or
Footage of me impaling myself on an elephant tusk?
We'll settle this once and for all, I'ma tell her at dusk
Tonight, tonight is the night, and tell her I must
Creep up to her mansion in stilettos, and just
Climb the gate, and ring the bell, like "Hello, my love"
I just picked your prescription for Seroquel up
Now would you like to share a pill or two with me?
I'll share my Valium with you 'cause I'm feeling you Britney
I'll trade you a blue one for a pink one
Ever since a schoolgirl juvenile delinquent
I've been feeling you, ooh-ooh, girl, you sexy little gal, you
Hold that pill any longer, it'll get sentimental value
C'mon toots, give me the Valium alley-oop
I'll slam dunk it in your mouth 'til you puke
And just as soon as you pass out in your alphabet soup
I'm 'bout to make a new outfit out of you
New outfit? Shit, I'll make a suit out of you, shoot
Now, show me how you move, baby, do how a-you do

Yeah baby, do that dance
It's the last dance you'll ever get the chance to do
Girl, shake that ass, you ain't never gonna break that glass
That windshield's too strong for you
I said, yeah baby, sing that song
It's the last song you'll ever get the chance to sing
You sexy little thing, show me what you got, give it your all
Look at you bawl, why you crying to me?
Same song and dance

Same kicking and screaming, same crying and sobbing
Same song and dance
Same begging and pleading, same yelling and bleeding
Same song and dance
Yeah
Same song and dance
I know
Same song and dance

Guess who? Did you miss me?
Jessica Simpson, sing the chorus!

When you walked through the door, it was clear to me (Clear to me!)
You're the one they adore, who they came to see (Who they came to see!)
You're a rock star (Baby!)
Everybody wants you (Everybody wants you)
Player!
Who could really blame you? (Who could really blame you?)
We're the ones who made you!

Back by popular demand
Now pop a little Zantac for antacid if you can
You're ready to tackle any task that is at hand
How does it feel: Is it fantastic, is it grand?
Well look at all the massive masses in the stands
Shady man, no, don't massacre the fans
Damn, I think Kim Kardashian's a man
She stomped him, just 'cause he asked to put his hands
On her massive gluteus maximus again
Squeeze it then squash it then pass it to a friend
Can he come back as nasty as he can?
Yes he can, can, don't ask me this again
He does not mean to lesbian offend
But Lindsay, please come back to seein' men
Samantha's a two, you're practically a ten
I know you want me girl, in fact I see ya grin
Now come in girl!

When you walked through the door, it was clear to me (Clear to me!)
You're the one they adore, who they came to see (Who they came to see!)
You're a rock star (Baby!)
Everybody wants you (Everybody wants you)
Player!
Who could really blame you? (Who could really blame you?)
We're the ones who made you!

The enforcer, look at the more women to torture
Walk up to the cutest girl and charlie-horse her
Sorry Portia, but what's Ellen DeGeneres
Have that I don't? Are you tellin' me tenderness?
Well I can be as gentle and as smooth as a gentleman
Give me my Ventolin inhaler and two Xenadrine
And I'll invite Sarah Palin out to dinner then
Nail her, "Baby, say hello to my little friend"
Brit, forget K-Fed, let's cut out the middleman
Forget him or you're gonna end up in the hospital again
And this time it won't be for the Ritalin binge
Forget them other men, girl pay them little attention
And little did I mention that Jennifer's in love with me John Mayer, so sit on the bench
Man, I swear them other guys you give 'em an inch
They take a mile, they got style, but it isn't Slim's

When you walked through the door, it was clear to me (Clear to me!)
You're the one they adore, who they came to see (Who they came to see!)
You're a rock star (Baby!)
Everybody wants you (Everybody wants you)
Player!
Who could really blame you? (Who could really blame you?)
We're the ones who made you!

And that's why, my love, you never live without
I know you want me girl
'Cause I can see you're checkin' me out
And baby, you know, you know you want me too
Don't try to deny it, baby, I'm the only one for you

Damn girl, I'm beginning to sprout an Alfalfa
Why should I wash my filthy mouth out?
You think that's bad, you should hear the rest of my album
Never has there been such finesse and nostalgia
Man Cash, I don't mean to mess with ya gal but
Jessica Alba, put a breast on my mouth, bruh
Wowzers! I just made a mess in my trousers
And they wonder why I keep dressing like Elvis
Lord help us, he's back in his pink Alf shirt
Lookin' like someone shrinked his outfit
I think he's 'bout to flip, Jessica
Rest assured, Superman's here to rescue ya
Can you blame me? You're my Amy, I'm your Blake
Matter fact, bake me a birthday cake
With a sawblade in it to make my jailbreak
Baby, I think you just met your soulmate
Now break it down, girl!

When you walked through the door, it was clear to me (Clear to me!)
You're the one they adore, who they came to see (Who they came to see!)
You're a rock star (Baby!)
Everybody wants you (Everybody wants you)
Player!
Who could really blame you? (Who could really blame you?)
We're the ones who made you!

So baby, baby
Get down, down, down (Baby!)
Get down, down, down (Baby!)
Get down, down, down (Baby!)
Get down, get down (Baby!)
Get down, down, down (Baby!)

Get down, get down

Oh Amy!
Rehab never looked so good!
I can't wait!
I'm going back!
Ha ha! Woo!
Dr. Dre
2020

Oh, my goodness
What have I done
Oh no
I can't believe it
It's like I've got the whole world in my palm
And I'm ready to drop bombs

Welcome to the Slim Shady Mecca Rebecca
It's the village in New York right next to the Tribeca
That's my sector
Homosexual dissector
Come again rewind selector

I said nice rectum
I had a vasectomy Hector
So you can't get pregnant if I bisexually wreck ya
Hannibal Lecter into guy sex and I bet ya
I tantalize ya in less than five seconds I get ya

They say once bitten and twice shy
Well lie next to the guy
With nine ecstasy pills and five extra boxes of ribbed condoms in quantities
Why yes sir
I took the rest of the Lunesta pills from my dresser

That's my kinda vibe what else should I try Lester
Drop-kick the bitch before her second trimester
Perform the home abortion with Dexter
Then I guess I'll dig her fetus out
With a wire hanger then digest her

I guess it's time for you to hate me again
Let's begin now hand me the pen
How should I begin it and where does it all end
The world is just my medicine ball you're all in

I said I guess it's time for you to hate me again
Let's begin now hand me the pen
How should I begin it and where does it all end
My medicine ball you're in my medicine ball friends

All my West Side bitches throw it up
Put a balloon inside your pussy, queef and blow it up
Man I think that he just fell off the deep end, sure enough
So you better change the station to keep from throwing up

Man you seen it all before you're all too familiar with it
There's a penis on the floor and two balls so you know who did it
You know you with it girl don't front, oh no you didn't I won't rape all the Pussycat Dolls? Nicole you kidding?

I'll pee on Rihanna
See man I do what I wanna
Spray perfume in the sauna room
Crazy-gluing Madonna
To the La-Z-Boy sofa
Fold her in two then sit on her
Imagine a visual for that man

Who would've thought I could ever be such a relentless prick
Unleashing his vengeance
But the chick's so old
She looks like she outlived a life sentence
I never meant this rhyme to be so offensive
If you weren't so defensive
It wouldn't be
You're so sensitive

I guess it's time for you to hate me again
Let's begin now hand me the pen
How should I begin it and where does it all end
The world is just my medicine ball you're all in

I said I guess it's time for you to hate me again
Let's begin now hand me the pen
How should I begin it and where does it all end
My medicine ball you're in my medicine ball friends

Put Christopher Reeves on a unicycle with a kickstand
Kick it up and push him and lead him right into quicksand
Here you need a hand, big man, grab hold of this branch
With both hands, man they don't understand I'm just a sick man

Now everybody's pissed at me like it's my fault
His name rhymes with so many different words
Jeeze
So one last time, Mister Christopher Reeves
Won't you break it down for me and just spit the verse please

Eminem I'm coming to kill you
Always hated you and I still do
You'll never fill my shoes
My Superman costume
Doesn't even fit you they don't feel you

You're taking this shit too far
Who d'you think you are?
Hang my suit up in the armoire
Every day I hate you more and more
Throw down the cardboard
Let's break-dance if you think you're hardcore

I guess it's time for you to hate me again
Let's begin now hand me the pen
How should I begin it and where does it all end
The world is just my medicine ball you're all in

I said I guess it's time for you to hate me again
Let's begin now hand me the pen
How should I begin it and where does it all end
My medicine ball you're in my medicine ball friends

The world is mine!

Yo, yo, follow me
Come with me to the dark side of the force
No man would boldly go to this place
The devil only knows of this world
So dark and oh so cold, it's oh so cold
Oh so cold, oh

Soon as my flow starts I compose art like the ghost of Mozart
Even though they all say that they're real, I know that most aren't
Boy, you think you're clever, don't ya?
Girl, you think you're so smart
Come with me to another side in a world so cold and so dark

(Stay wide awake)
A world so dark, a world so cold
A world where only some will go
(Stay wide awake)
But none return, when will they learn?
Where do they go? God only knows
(Stay wide awake)

Fe-fi-fo-fum, I think I smell the scent of a placenta
I enter Central Park, it's dark, it's winter in December
I see my target, put my car in park and approach a tender
Young girl by the name of Brenda and I pretend to befriend her
Sit down beside her like a spider, hi there girl, you might've
Heard of me before, see whore
You're the kind of girl that I'd assault and rape
Then figure why not try to make your pussy wider
Fuck you with an umbrella
Then open it up while the shit's inside ya
I'm the kind of guy that's mild
But I might flip and get a little bit wilder
Impregnate a lesbian, yeah
Now let's see her have triplets, and I'll disintegrate them babies
As soon as they're out her with formaldehyde and cyanide
Girl, you can try and hide, you can try to scream louder
No need for no gunpowder, that only takes all the fun out of
Murderin', I'd rather go vinn-vinn, and now you see just how the
Fuck I do just what I do when I cut right through your scalp, uhh
Shit, wait a minute, I mean skull
My knife seems dull, pull another one out, uh

Soon as my flow starts, I compose art like the ghost of Mozart
Even though they all say that they're real, I know that most aren't
Boy, you think you're clever, don't ya?
Girl, you think you're so smart
Come with me to another side in a world so cold and so dark

(Stay wide awake)
A world so dark, a world so cold
A world where only some will go
(Stay wide awake)
But none return, when will they learn?
Where do they go? God only knows
(Stay wide awake)

So dark and so cold, my friends don't know this other side of me
There's a monster inside of me, it's quite ugly and it frightens me
But they can't see what I can see, there's a vacancy in my tummy
It's making me play hide-and-seek like Jason, I'm so hungry
She's naked, see, no privacy but I can see she wants me
So patient, see, I try to be but gee, why does she taunt me?
Pulls the drapes and she goes right to sleep
And I creep right through the front, see
So blatantly, but silently 'cause I know that she's sound 'sleep
"Who's waking me so violently, and why's he on top of me?"
"He's raping me," she tries to scream
"Somebody please get him off me
He's taping me, he's biting me, he's laughing like it's funny"
She's scraping me, she's fighting me
She's scratching like some dumb freak
Escaping me, no dice, you see, I might just be Ted Bundy
Or Satan, gee, what a sight to see, I'm dancing in my red panties
I'm crazy, but it's alright with me, man, life can be so empty
Stay away from me 'cause I'm dancing
To quite a different drum beat

Soon as my flow starts I compose art like the ghost of Mozart
Even though they all say that they're real, I know that most aren't
Boy, you think you're clever, don't ya?
Girl, you think you're so smart
Come with me to another side in a world so cold and so dark

(Stay wide awake)
A world so dark, a world so cold
A world where only some will go
(Stay wide awake)
But none return, when will they learn?
Where do they go? God only knows
(Stay wide awake)

Better try to stay wide awake
Or you might end up found dead by the lake
Soon as you lay me down to sleep
Bitch, your soul I'mma try to take
Pray for light of day right away
Why do they try to fight today?
I must make them pay twice as much
Might as well put the knife away
Now I use power tools, how 'bout now, are you in the shower?
Scour you for six hours 'til outage of power outlets
How did you figure out I was down in your basement? Now ya
Must've just heard the sound of my stomach
Growling from down there
Prowler, there's no one fouler
Bound ya, that's how they found ya
Face down in the tub, I drown ya
With piles of downers around ya
Such nostalgia and power, such prowess, look how you cower
Jump out on you now like I was a Jawa from fuckin' Star Wars
Jabba the Hutt, beddy-bye-bye
Beddy-bye-bye, it's time to die-die
Ought to not even bother to scream, it don't even matter
Amazing when grazing skin with these razor blades he waves at ya
Not ya everyday Damien, bathe me in holy water
Nothing like Son of Sam, so please understand
There's no gun in hand
Where's the thrill in the hunt?
There's no fun in that, here I come with axe
Fun to act like lumberjack when I'm hacking 'em up with that
What was that? Dial 9-1-1, someone's coming in from the back

Soon as my flow starts, I compose art like the ghost of Mozart
Even though they all say that they're real, I know that most aren't
Boy, you think you're clever, don't ya?
Girl, you think you're so smart
Come with me to another side in a world so cold and so dark

(Stay wide awake)
A world so dark, a world so cold
A world where only some will go
(Stay wide awake)
But none return, when will they learn?
Where do they go? God only knows
(Stay wide awake)

Good evening
This is your fucking captain speaking
We will soon be reaching an altitude of
Four million and a half.. feet
That's eight million miles in the sky
Please... undo your seat belt for takeoff (chkk)
You are now free to smoke about the cabin (chkka)

I'm Dre, from back in the day
From N.W.A, from black and the gray
From choking a bitch, to smacking her face
From stacking up bodies, to racking AKs up
From racking up hits, to stacking them crates up
I'm still hungry, and I'm back with a tapeworm
And we're what's happenin' in rap entertainment
Me and Shady, as far as competition, faggot, there ain't none

Speak of the Devil, it's attack of the Rain Man
Chainsaw in hand, bloodstain on my apron
Soon as the blade spun, vrrunn, they run away from
Who wanna play dungeon? No one is safe from
In search of a brain surgeon, a great one
Wait, it ain't funny, man, it's urgent, I need one
Two boxes of detergent in a paint gun
And an emergency squirt gun to spray A-1

So one more time for old time's sake
Dre, drop that beat and scratch that break
Now just blow a little bit of that smoke my way
And let's go (You are now smoking with the best)
I said, one more time for old time's sake
Dre, drop that beat and scratch that break
Now just send a little bit of that smoke my way
And let's go (You are now smoking with the best)

Smoke signal in the sky like Verizon Wireless
A nice environment, surprised entirely
Hypnotized by the sound, I surround the hydrants
Taking lives of firemen; say goodbye, here I am again
Naked wives and Vicodin
Before I begin to get so high, pussy boy, I could spin
Vinn-vinn, fuck the handle, I fly off the hinge
Let that boy off the bench, coach, and throw it to him
There he goes in his trench coat, no clothes again
Baby, make us some French toast and show us some skin
I'll show you every inch grows on my foreskin
Show me nipple, I pinch both, and throw up a ten
Now you know it's a sin to tease, blow us again
The sorcerer of intercourse; if it's forced, it's him
Don't fight the feeling if you're feeling the force within
And when you wake up in the morning next to the porcelain

So one more time for old time's sake
Dre, drop that beat and scratch that break
Now just blow a little bit of that smoke my way
And let's go (You are now smokin' with the best)
I said, one more time for old time's sake
Dre, drop that beat and scratch that break
Now just send a little bit of that smoke my way
And let's go (You are now smokin' with the best)

Now where there's smoke, there's fire
Where there's fire, there's flames
Where there's flames, there's chronic
Either you high or you ain't
I got no time for no games

Nuh-uh, he ain't playin'
He's gon' get the AK and aim it right at your brain
I'm slightly insane, vodka and creatine
Hpnotiq and Red Bull, it's an incredible energy drink
And it's given me wings, I believe I can fly
While I pee on a girl, you won't catch me CSI
It's as easy as pie, and as simple as cake
Dre, get on the mic and make 'em tremble and shake

Now put your smoke up in the air, raise your Henny and Coke
And if you really wanna get fucked up, just let me know
We can smoke 'til there's no more lighter fluid to do it
Let's get into it, you're smokin' with the triedest and truest
I got the Midas touch when it comes to rollin' shit up
You motherfuckers ain't smokin', you just holdin' shit up
Now here we go, let's get up, get down, hold up a blunt
I smoke the kinda stuff that make the records go number one
'Cause if at first you don't succeed
Won't hurt to smoke some weed
Now them words are just a little more personal for me
Seeing as how I blew up off of puffing them trees

Well smoke enough for me, fuck yeah, light it up, Cheech
Come on, smoke me out cuz, give me contact buzz
Get me on track, they love me when I'm on that stuff
But this is Earth calling Shady, man, come on back—What?
Man, we're losing him, he won't even respond back, fuck!
Now look at all the pretty women in here (Damn, bitches!)
Dre, it's hot, I think we better go check on their temperatures
I'll get the thermometer, you get the bandages
Now baby, just bend over, this won't hurt a damn bit, just—

Give me one more time for old time's sake
Dre, drop that beat and scratch that break
Now just blow a little bit of that smoke my way
And let's go (You are now smokin' with the best)
I said, one more time for old time's sake
Dre, drop that beat and scratch that break
Now just send a little bit of that smoke my way
And let's go (You are now smokin' with the best)

Yeah, (oh, oh), yeah yeah, oh
I feel like dancing, I feel like dancing
I smell something in the air that's making me high
I said I smell something in the air that's making me high

(OK here we go) do-re-me-fa-so-fa-so-la-ti-da-so
Lyrical rascal, kick back the Tabasco
You motherfuckers must just not know the tick-tock, so
Time to show you the most kick-ass flow in the cosmos
Picasso with a pick axe, a sick asshole
Tic-tac-toe comes with six-pack with Exacto
Knives, strangling wives with thick lasso
Big bags of the grass, Zig-Zags, I'm with the Doc, so
You know how that go, skull and the crossbones
This is poison to boys and girls who do not know
You do not want to try this at home, my lil' vato
This is neither the time nor the place to get macho
So crack a six-pack, sit back with some nachos
Maybe some popcorn and watch the show and just rock slow
It's not what you expected, not what you thought, so
'Bout time that you wake the fuck up, smell the pot smoke

It must be the ganja, it's the marijuana
That's creeping up on me, why I'm so high
Maybe it's the Henny that has gotten in me
Whatever's got into me, I don't mind
I said it's the ganja, it's the marijuana
That's creeping up on me, why I'm so high
Maybe it's the Henny that has gotten in me
Whatever's got into me, I don't mind

Your dreams are getting fulfilled, ooh I'm literally getting a chill
Spitting at will, me and Dre have just finished splitting a pill
You're submitting to skill, sitting still
I'm admitting I'm beginning to feel like I don't think anyone's real
Faced with a dilemma: I can be Dalai Lama
And be calm or bring drama, a step beyond of Jeffrey Dahmer
Please don't upset me, mama, you're looking sexy, mama
Don't know if it's the lala or the rum and Pepsi, mama
Don't wanna end up inside my refrigerator freezer
Be used as extra topping the next time I make a pizza
How many people you know
Who can name every serial killer who ever existed in a row?
Put 'em in chronological order, beginning with Jack the Ripper
Name the time and place; from the body, the bag, the zipper
Location of the woods
Where the body was dragged and then dumped
The trunk that they were stuffed in, the model, the make, the plate
And which model, which lake they found her in
How they attacked the victim
Say which murder weapon was used to do what in which one
Which knife and which gun, what kid, what wife, and which nun
Don't stop, I like this, it's fun, the fucking night's just begun

It must be the ganja, it's the marijuana
That's creeping up on me, why I'm so high
Maybe it's the Henny that has gotten in me
Whatever's got into me, I don't mind
I said it's the ganja, it's the marijuana
That's creeping up on me, why I'm so high
Maybe it's the Henny that has gotten in me
Whatever's got into me, I don't mind

When I'm behind the mic, dynamite's what it's kinda like
You're stuck with the same stick that you're tryna light
Behind the board sits Dre, legends are made this way
Isn't it safe to say, this is the way it should be?
Maybe you need some lyric syrup serum for your symptoms
Here's a dosage of the antidote now you give him some
He can give her some, she can give them some, get behind a Linn Drum
Make up a beat and cure the sucker syndrome
The spinnin' drum when it comes to lyrics and pennin' some
Starting from scratch and then ending up at the endin' of
Capable of winning a Pulitzer so unbelievable it's a
Titanium cranium that's full of sur-
Prises when the smoke rises right before your very own eyes
You stare into your stereos high
Good evening, this isn't even a weed thing
I ain't even smoke anything I ain't even drinking

It must be the ganja, it's the marijuana
That's creeping up on me, why I'm so high
Maybe it's the Henny that has gotten in me
Whatever's got into me, I don't mind
I said it's the ganja, it's the marijuana
That's creeping up on me, why I'm so high
Maybe it's the Henny that has gotten in me
Whatever's got into me, I don't mind

D.M.C. we have a mid 30s male
Found down unresponsive
Possible overdose
Substance unknown
Pulse is 60 and thready
Respiration's 8 he's intubated
And we're bagging him now
Uuh B.P. 90 over palp
Patient cool pale and diaphoretic
Has aspirated
Uuh G.S.C. is 3
We'll update en route
E.T.A. 10 minutes

As I fall deeper into a manic state
I'm a prime candidate for the gene to receive the drug addict trait
Blood pressure climbs at a dramatic rate
I seem to gravitate to the bottle of NyQuil then I salivate
Start off with the NyQuil like I think I'll just have a taste
Couple of sips of that then I gradually graduate
To a harder prescription drug called Valium like ya that's great
I go to just take one and I end up like having eight
Now I need something in my stomach cause I haven't ate
Maybe I'll grab a plate of nachos and I'll have a steak
And you'd think that with all I have at stake
Look at my daughter's face... "Mommy, something is wrong with dad, I think
He's acting weird again he's really beginning to scare me
Won't shave his beard again and he pretends he doesn't hear me
And all he does is eat dorritos and cheetos
And he just fell asleep in his car eating three musketeers in the rear seat."

Sometimes I feel so alone
I just don't know
Feels like I been down this road before
So lonely and cold
It's like something takes over me
Soon as I go home and close the door
Kinda feels like déjà vu
I wanna get away from this place I do
But I can't and I won't say I tried but I know that's a lie cause I don't
And why? I just don't know

Maybe just a nice cold brew what's a beer
That's the devil in my ear I've been sober a fucking year
And that fucker still talks to me he's all I can fucking hear
Marshall, come on, we'll watch the game it's the cowboys and buccaneers
And maybe if I just drink half I'll be half-buzzed for half of the time
Who's the mastermind behind that little line?
With that kind of rationale man I got half a mind
To have another half of glass of wine sound asinine
Ya I know
But I never had no problem with alcohol
Ouch, look out for the wall aim for the couch I'm about to fall
I missed the couch and down I go looking like a bouncy ball
Shit must have knocked me out 'cause I ain't feel the ground at all
Wow, what the fuck happened last night, where am I?
Man fuck am I hungover and god damn I got a head ache
Shit half a Vicodin, why can't I?
"All systems ready for take off, please, stand by"

Sometimes I feel so alone
I just don't know
Feels like I been down this road before
So lonely and cold
It's like something takes over me
Soon as I go home and close the door
Kinda feels like déjà vu
I wanna get away from this place I do
But I can't and I won't say I tried but I know that's a lie cause I don't
And why? I just don't know

So I take a Vicodin splash it hits my stomach and ah
A couple weeks go by it ain't even like I'm getting high
Now I need it just not to feel sick ya I'm getting by
Wouldn't even be taking this shit if DeShaun didn't die
Oh ya there's an excuse you lose Proof so you use
There's new rules it's cool if it's helping you to get through
It's twelve noon ain't no harm in self-inducing a snooze
What else is new? Fuck it, what would Elvis do in your shoes?
Now here I am three months later full-blown relapse
Just get high until the kids get home from school homes relax
And since I'm convinced that I'm an insomniac I need these pills to be able to sleep so I take 3 naps
Just to be able to function throughout the day let's see
That's an Ambien each nap how many Valium? Three
And that will average out to about one good hour's sleep
OK, so now you see the reason how come he
Has taken four years to just put out an album beat
See me and you we almost had the same outcome heath
Cause that Christmas you know the whole pneumonia thing
It was Bologna was it the methadone ya think
Or the hydrocodone you hide inside your pornos
Your VCR tape cases with your Ambient CR great places to hide 'em, ain't it
So you can lie to Hailie
I'm going beddy bye Whitney baby good night Alaina
Go in the room and shut the bedroom door and wake up in an ambulance
They said they found me on the bathroom floor... Damn

Sometimes I feel so alone
I just don't know
Feels like I been down this road before
So lonely and cold
It's like something takes over me
Soon as I go home and close the door
Kinda feels like déjà vu
I wanna get away from this place I do
But I can't and I won't say I tried but I know that's a lie cause I don't
And why? I just don't know

I'm just so fuckin' depressed, I just can't seem to get out this slump
If I could just get over this hump
But I need something to pull me out this dump,
I took my bruises, took my lumps
Fell down and I got right back up
But I need that spark to get psyched back up
In order for me to pick the mic back up
I don't know how or why or when I ended up in this position I'm in
I'm starting to feel distant again
So I decided just to pick this pen
Up and try to make an attempt to vent
But I just can't admit
Or come to grips with the fact that I may be done with rap
I need a new outlet, and I know some shit's so hard to swallow
But I just can't sit back and wallow
In my own sorrow
But I know one fact I'll be one tough act to follow
One tough act to follow
I'll be one tough act to follow
Here today, gone tomorrow
But you'd have to walk a thousand miles

In my shoes, just to see
What it's like, to be me
I'll be you, let's trade shoes
Just to see what it'd be like to
Feel your pain, you feel mine
Go inside each other's minds
Just to see what we find
Look at shit through each other's eyes
But don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful, oh
They can all get fucked.
Just stay true to you
So don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful
Oh, they can all get fucked.
Just stay true to you, yeah, so...

I think I'm starting to lose my sense of humor
Everything is so tense and gloom
I almost feel like I gotta check the temperature in the room
Just as soon as I walk in
It's like all eyes on me
So I try to avoid any eye contact
'Cause if I do that then it opens the door for conversation
Like I want that... I'm not looking for extra attention
I just want to be just like you
Blend in with the rest of the room
Maybe just point me to the closest restroom
I don't need no fucking man servant
Trying to follow me around and wipe my ass
Laugh at every single joke I crack
And half of them ain't even funny like
"Ha!, Marshall you're so funny man, you should be a comedian, God damn"
Unfortunately I am, but I just hide behind the tears of a clown
So why don't you all sit down?
Listen to the tale I'm about to tell
Hell, we don't gotta trade our shoes
And you ain't gotta walk no thousand miles

In my shoes, just to see
What it's like, to be me
I'll be you, let's trade shoes
Just to see what it'd be like to
Feel your pain, you feel mine
Go inside each other's minds
Just to see what we find
Look at shit through each other's eyes
But don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful
Oh they can all get fucked.
Just stay true to you so
Don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful
Oh they can all get fucked.
Just stay true to you so

Nobody asked for life to deal us
With these bullshit hands we're dealt
We gotta take these cards ourselves
And flip them, don't expect no help
Now I could have either just
Sat on my ass and pissed and moaned
Or take this situation in which I'm placed in
And get up and get my own
I was never the type of kid
To wait by the door and pack his bags
Who sat on the porch and hoped and prayed
For a dad to show up who never did
I just wanted to fit in
In every single place
Every school I went
I dreamed of being that cool kid
Even if it meant acting stupid

Aunt Edna always told me "Keep makin' that face it'll get stuck like that"
Meanwhile I'm just standin' there
Holdin' my tongue tryna talk like this
'Til I stuck my tongue on that frozen stop sign pole at 8 years old
I learned my lesson then cause I wasn't tryna impress my friends no more
But I already told you my whole life story
Not just based on my description
'Cause where you see it from where you're sitting
It's probably 110% different
I guess we would have to walk a mile
In each other's shoes, at least
What size you wear? I wear tens
Let's see if you can fit your feet

In my shoes, just to see
What it's like, to be me
I'll be you, let's trade shoes
Just to see what it'd be like to
Feel your pain, you feel mine
Go inside each other's minds
Just to see what we find
Look at shit through each other's eyes
But don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful, oh
They can all get fucked.
Just stay true to you
So don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful
Oh, they can all get fucked.
Just stay true to you, yeah, so...

Yeah... To my babies. Stay strong.
Daddy will be home soon
And to the rest of the world, God gave you them shoes
To fit you, so put 'em on and wear 'em
Be yourself, man, be proud of who you are
Even if it sounds corny,
Don't ever let no one tell you, you ain't beautiful
So...

Oh! Ladies and gentlemen
The moment you've all been waiting for
In this corner, weighing 175 pounds
With a record of 17 rapes, 400 assaults, and 4 murders
The undisputed, most diabolical villain in the world
Slim Shady! (Let's go!)

So crack a bottle, let your body waddle
Don't act like a snobby model, you just hit the lotto
Oh-oh, oh-oh, bitches hoppin' in my Tahoe
Got one ridin' shotgun and no, not one of 'em got clothes
Now, where's the rubbers? Who's got the rubbers?
I noticed there's so many of 'em
And there's really not that many of us
And ladies love us, my posse's kickin' up dust
It's on 'til the break of dawn and we're starting this party from dusk

Okay, let's go!

Back with Andre the Giant, Mr. Elephant Tusk
Fix your musk, you'll be just another one bit the dust
Just one of my mother's sons who got thrown under the bus
Kiss my butt, lick fromunda cheese from under my nuts
It disgusts me to see the game the way that it looks
It's a must, I redeem my name and haters get mushed
Bitches lust, man, they love me when I lay in the cut
Fisticuffs, the lady give her eighty-some paper cuts
Now picture us; it's ridiculous, you curse at the thought
'Cause when I spit the verse the shit gets worse than Worcestershire sauce
If I could fit the words, it's picture perfect, works every time
Every verse, every line, as simple as nursery rhymes
It's elementary, the elephants have entered the room
I venture to say we're the center of attention, it's true
Not to mention back with a vengeance, so hence the signal
Of the bat symbol, the platinum trio's back on you hoes

So crack a bottle, let your body waddle
Don't act like a snobby model, you just hit the lotto
Oh-oh, oh-oh, bitches hoppin' in my Tahoe
Got one ridin' shotgun and no, not one of 'em got clothes
Now, where's the rubbers? Who's got the rubbers?
I noticed there's so many of 'em
And there's really not that many of us
And ladies love us, my posse's kickin' up dust
It's on 'til the break of dawn and we're starting this party from dusk

Ladies and gentlemen, Dr. Dre!

They see that low rider go by, they're like, "Oh my!"
You ain't got to tell me why you're sick 'cause I know why
I dip through in that Six-Trey like, "Sick 'em, Dre!"
I'm an itch that they can't scratch, they're sick of me
But hey, what else can I say? I love L.A
'Cause over and above all, it's just another day
And this one begins where the last one ends
Pick up where we left off and get smashed again
I'll be damned, just fucked around and crashed my Benz
Drivin' 'round with a smashed front end, let's cash that one in
Grab another one from out the stable
The Monte Carlo, El Camino, or the El Dorado?
The hell if I know, do I want leather seats or vinyl?
Decisions, decisions, garage looks like Precision Collision
Or Maaco, beats quake like Waco
Just keep the bass low, speakers away from your face though

So crack a bottle, let your body waddle
Don't act like a snobby model, you just hit the lotto
Oh-oh, oh-oh, bitches hoppin' in my Tahoe
Got one ridin' shotgun and no, not one of 'em got clothes
Now, where's the rubbers? Who's got the rubbers?
I noticed there's so many of 'em
And there's really not that many of us
And ladies love us, my posse's kickin' up dust
It's on 'til the break of dawn and we're starting this party from dusk

And I take great pleasure in introducing 50 Cent!

It's bottle after bottle
The money ain't a thing when you party with me
It's what we into, it's simple
We ball out of control like you wouldn't believe
I'm the napalm, the bomb, the Don, I'm King Kong
Get rolled on, wrapped up, and reigned on
I'm so calm, through Vietnam, ring the alarm
Bring the Chandon, burn marijuana, do what you want
Nigga, on and on 'til the break of what?
Get the paper, man, I'm cakin', you know I don't give a fuck
I spend it like it don't mean nothin'
Blow it like it's supposed to be blown, motherfucker, I'm grown
I stunt, I style, I flash the shit (Uh huh)
I gets what the fuck I want, so what I trick? (Yeah)
Fat-ass Birkin bags, some classy shit (Haha)
Jimmy Choo shoes; I say, "Move," a bitch move

So crack a bottle, let your body waddle
Don't act like a snobby model, you just hit the lotto
Oh-oh, oh-oh, bitches hoppin' in my Tahoe
Got one ridin' shotgun and no, not one of 'em got clothes
Now, where's the rubbers? Who's got the rubbers?
I noticed there's so many of 'em
And there's really not that many of us
And ladies love us, my posse's kickin' up dust
It's on 'til the break of dawn and we're starting this party from dusk

A lot of people ask me
Where the fuck I've been at the last few years
Shit, I don't know
But I do know I'm back now
Haha

Here comes the rain and thunder now
Nowhere to run, to run to now
I disappeared, don't wonder how
Lookin' for me? I'm underground
Here comes the rain and thunder now
Nowhere to run, to run to now
I disappeared, don't wonder how
Lookin' for me? I'm underground

Dre, I'm down here, under the ground, dig me up!
Broken tibias, fibias, yeah, fix me up
Sixty sluts, all of them dyin' from asphyxia
After they sip piss through a Christopher Reeves sippy cup
Dixie cups, toxins, boxes of Oxy pads
Enough Oxycontin to send a fuckin' ox to rehab
Wack job in the back in a black stocking cap
Jackin' off to a hockey mask at a boxing match
(He can't say that!) Yes, he can
I just did, faggot, now guess again
Better text message your next-of-kin
Tell 'em shit's about to get extra messy
Especially when I flex again
And throw a fuckin' lesbian in wet cement
Faggoty, faggoty, faggoty! Raggedy Ann and Andy
No! Raggedy Andy and Andy
No, it can't be, it can't be—yes, it can be
The fuckin' Antichrist is back, Dante
It's Satan in black satin panties
This is Amityville, calamity, goddamn it
Insanity, pills, fanny pack filled with Xannies
Through every nook and cranny, lookin' for trannies
Milk and cookies spilled on my silk négligée, looky
Razor blades with me to make you bleed
Cases of Maybelline make-up lay on a table of weed
Slim Shady? Shit sounds like a fable to me
'Til he jumps out of the fuckin' toilet when you're takin' a pee

Here comes the rain and thunder now
Nowhere to run, to run to now
I disappeared, don't wonder how
Lookin' for me? I'm underground
Here comes the rain and thunder now
Nowhere to run, to run to now
I disappeared, don't wonder how
Lookin' for me? I'm underground

Six semen samples, seventeen strands of hair
Found in the back of a van after the shoot with Vanity Fair
Hannah Montana, prepare to elope with a can opener
And be cut open like cantaloupe on canopy beds
And Glad bags, yeah glad to be back
'Cause last year was a tragedy that landed me smack-dab in rehab
Fuckin' doctor, I ain't understand a damn word he said
I planned to relapse the second I walked out of that bitch
Two weeks in Brighton, I ain't enlightened
Bitin' into a fuckin' Vicodin like I'm a Viking
Oh, lightning is strikin', it might be a fuckin' sign I need a psychic
Evaluation, fuck Jason, it's Friday the 19th
That means it's just a regular day (hah!)
And this is the kind of shit I think of regularly
Fuckin' lesbian shouldn't have had her legs in the way
Now she's pregnant and gay, missin' both legs and beggin' to stay

Here comes the rain and thunder now
Nowhere to run, to run to now
I disappeared, don't wonder how
Lookin' for me? I'm underground
Here comes the rain and thunder now
Nowhere to run, to run to now
I disappeared, don't wonder how
Lookin' for me? I'm underground

Tell the critics I'm back and I'm comin' to spit it back in abundance
Hit a fag with onions, then split a bag of Funyuns
Mad at me? Understandable, cannibal, shoot an animal
Out of a cannon and have 'em catapult at an adult
Captain of a cult with an elite following
To turn Halloween back into a trick-or-treat holiday
Have Michael Myers lookin' like a liar, swipe his powers
Replace his knife with flowers and a stack of fliers
Hit Jason Vorhees with a 40; stuck a suppository
Up his ass, and made him tell me a story
Gave Hannibal Lecter a fuckin' nectarine
And sat him in the fuckin' fruit and vegetable section
And gave him a lecture
Walked up Elm Street with a fuckin' Wiffle bat drew
Fought Freddy Krueger and Edward Scissorhands too
And came out with a little scratch, ooh
Lookin' like I got in a fuckin' pillow fight with a Triple F.A.T. goose
Insanity, can it be vanity?
Where's the humanity in having a twisted fantasy
With an arm-and-leg amputee?
Straitjacket with a hundred and eight brackets
And a strap that wraps twice around my back
Then they latch it; cut your fuckin' head off
And ask where you're headed off to
Get it? "Headed off to?" Medic, this headache's awful!
This anesthetic's pathetic, so is this diabetic waffle
And this prosthetic arm keeps crushin' my hard taco

Here comes the rain and thunder now
Nowhere to run, to run to now
I disappeared, don't wonder how
Lookin' for me? I'm underground
Here comes the rain and thunder now
Nowhere to run, to run to now
I disappeared, don't wonder how
Lookin' for me? I'm underground

So, it wasn't a choice, it was "I had to do this."
And now I got 90 days clean
And uh, that's all I have to share, thanks
(Thanks for sharing, Brian
Is there anyone else who'd like to share this evening?)
Yeah, I got something to share:
"When you walked through the door you were queer to me
So come here, baby boy, just come here to me
You're a cock-boy, everybody wants you
You're gayer than you would ever claim to
I won't have to rape you
So, homie, lay down, down, down
Lay down, down, down
Lay down, down, down, lay down, lay down."
Where's everybody going?
This always went over real big in Gay-A
Okay, wait, I got another one
"I just love condoms and lots of cum."
No? Well, shit!

Look, if I were to rap
About the crap
That's out
That's the route
You'd probably want me to take
'Cause you're just dyin' to know what I think
And my take on some other rappers

If I was to say something about Paul Wall
You'd probably crap in your pants
'Cause I'm white, and he's white
So he's like my competition
I mean, right?

Nope, Paul Wall is dope
And so's Bubba, so
But I don't compete with nobody
I just go hard, do the rope-a-dope Ali Shuffle
And dance around my opponents, do donuts
Sometimes I play possum
Like I'm asleep it's awesome
I'm like a sleeping giant
And when I awake I'm like Dre
I just jump from outta nowhere and bite prey
And sink my teeth in 'em and fill 'em full of poison
And make a noise like a snake before I kill 'em
And let 'em know that I just don't feel 'em
And smack 'em with the backward E, the Eminem emblem

I was taught if you're gonna murder somebody you should face em
Tell em why
Look them dead in the eye
Then waste 'em
And the dark shall emerge from the fiery depths of hell
And swallow the shell of the hollow who dwell
In the shadows of all who are willing to sell
Their souls for this rap game and it goes
1, 2, 3 (check, check) 1, 2, 3 (check, check) 1, 2, 3
That ain't the hook, now follow me

There's nothing else for me to say
My public adores me
Everybody bores me
They're just so corny
So at night before I sleep I look in the mirror
The mirror grows lips and it whispers, "Come nearer."

My darling
I don't ever want you to leave me my darling
You and me were meant to be together my darling
And if I cannot have you, no one can, you're my darling
'Cause I possess your soul, your mind, your heart and your body

I don't ever want you to leave me my darling
You and me were meant to be together my darling
And if I cannot have you, no one can, you're my darling
'Cause I possess your soul, your mind, your heart and your body

"Shady, I know you're in there somewhere. Come here
Talk to me, sit. Here, pull up a chair
Why don't you cut your hair?
Dye it back, come on, try it."
Ah, no, I told you, leave me the fuck alone, will you?
"But I'm here to rebuild you."
But I already killed you!
"But Shady, we were meant for each other
Think about your mother."
Yeah so what of her?
"You think about what she did to you and your little brother
All them foster homes."
Fuck you motherfucker! I had you beat
"No I was playin' possum
Remember? I let you watch your little girls blossom
I gave you enough time
Your soul's mine
I'm taking it back."
You fucking bitch why!?
"Because I love you. Look a little closer
Isn't that us on that poster?"
Ha-ha-ha-ha!"

My darling
I don't ever want you to leave me my darling
You and me were meant to be together my darling
And if I cannot have you, no one can, you're my darling
'Cause I possess your soul, your mind, your heart and your body

I don't ever want you to leave me my darling
You and me were meant to be together my darling
And if I cannot have you, no one can, you're my darling
'Cause I possess your soul, your mind, your heart and your body

"Shady, listen..."
(Shady!)
"You hear that?
They're screaming for you, I can bring your career back"
But I don't want it back!
"Yes you do."
No I don't!
"Yes you do, you're gonna regret it later!"
No I won't!
"I'mma get Dre on the phone, I'll just call the Doctor"
Go ahead, I already talked to Dre yesterday
"Well I got him on the phone right now!"
(Slim!)
You're lying
"Yo Slim"
How, why now! What up Dre?
"Check this out Slim, I gotta talk to ya
I don't know, it just seems like ever since you got off your
Drugs, you became a lot softer"
But Dre, all Shady is is a bottle of hair bleach and vodka
"Well, just think about it Slim, I'm here
Just hit me back, and let me know what's up"
Fuck this mirror!
"I'm not in the mirror, I'm inside you
Let me guide you"
Fuck you, die you son of a bitch
"Put the gun down"
Bye bye!
OK I'm still alive
"So am I too!
You can't kill a spirit, even if you tried to
You sold your soul to me. Need I remind you?
You remember that night you prayed to God
You'd give anything to get a record deal
Well Dre signed you
This is what you wanted your whole life Marshall, right ooh?
Look at this house, look at these cars, they're so nice, woo!
Oh, but you didn't know fame has a price too
That you're just now seeing the downside to
Lose your best friend from high school, your wife too
Ain't even sure if your kids like you
Come off tour, can't even sleep at night without NyQuil
Become a Valium addict, start a rehab cycle
But together we can break the cycle
Marshall."
What!
"No one's gonna love you like I do!"

My darling
I don't ever want you to leave me my darling
You and me were meant to be together my darling
And if I cannot have you, no one can, you're my darling
'Cause I possess your soul, your mind, your heart and your body

I don't ever want you to leave me my darling
You and me were meant to be together my darling
And if I cannot have you, no one can, you're my darling
'Cause I possess your soul, your mind, your heart and your body

I said, I don't ever want you to leave me my darling
You and me were meant to be together my darling
And if I cannot have you, no one can, you're my darling
'Cause I possess your soul, your mind, your heart and your body

So this is it...
This is what I wished for
Just isn't how I envisioned it
Famed to the point of imprisonment
I just thought the shit'd be different
But something changed
The minute that I got a whiff of it
I started to inhale it
Smell it
Started sniffin' it
And it became my cocaine
I just couldn't quit
I just wanted a little bit
Then it turned me (in) to a monster
I became a hypocrite
Concert after concert

I was raking in the dough
Rolling in green
Had the game hemmed up
Like a sewing machine
But I was losing my freedom
There was nowhere for me
To not go and be seen
And just go and be me
And there was no in-between
You either loved it or hate it

Every CD critics gave it a 3, then 3
Years later, they'd go back and re-rate it
And call the Slim Shady LP the greatest
The Marshall Mathers was a classic
The Eminem Show was fantastic
But Encore just didn't have the caliber to match it
I guess enough time just ain't passed, yet
A couple more years, that shit'll be ill-matic
And eight years later, I'm still at it
Divorced, re-married
A felon
A father
Sleeping-pill addict
And this is real talk
I feel like The Incredible Hulk
My back has been broke, and I can still walk

So be careful what you wish for
'Cause you just might get it
And if you get it then you just might not know
What to do wit' it, 'cause it might just
Come back on you ten-fold

I said

Be careful what you wish for
'Cause you just might get it
And if you get it then you just might not know
What to do wit' it, 'cause it might just
Come back on you ten-fold

I got a letter from a fan, that said
He's been praying for me
Every day and for some reason
It's been weighing on my mind heavy
'Cause I don't read every
Letter I get, but something told me to go ahead and open it, but
Why would someone pray for you when they don't know you?
You didn't pray for me when I was local
And as I lay these vocals
I think of all the shit I had to go through
Just to get to where I'm at
I've already told you at least

A thousand times in these rhymes
I appreciate the prayer, but I've already got
God on my side
And it's been one hell of a ride, hasn't it?
Just watchin' it from a opposite standpoint
Man, boy's got to look
Nuts
And that's the only word I can think of right now
On how
To describe the shit
This is like a vibe you get
Go ahead and bob to it
Just watch what you wish for, 'cause I got the shit

So be careful what you wish for
'Cause you just might get it
And if you get it then you just might not know
What to do wit' it, 'cause it might just
Come back on you ten-fold

I said

Be careful what you wish for
'Cause you just might get it
And if you get it then you just might not know
What to do wit' it, 'cause it might just
Come back on you ten-fold

It may not mean nothing to y'all
But understand nothing was done for me
So I don't plan on stopping at all
I want this shit forever man, ever man, ever man
I'm shutting shit down in the mall
And telling every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even planning to call
I want this shit forever man, ever man, ever man, ever man

Last name Ever
First name Greatest
Like a sprained ankle boy I ain't nothing to play with
Started off local but thanks to all the haters
I know G-IV pilots on a first name basis
In your city faded off the brown, Nino
She insist she got more class, we know
Swimming in the money come and find me, Nemo
If I was at the club you know I balled, chemo
Dropped the mixtape that shit sounded like a album
Who'd have thought a country-wide tour'd be the outcome
Labels want my name beside a X like Malcolm
Everybody got a deal, I did it without one
Yeah nigga I'm about my business
Killing all these rappers you would swear I had a hit list
Everyone who doubted me is asking for forgiveness
If you ain't been a part of it at least you got to witness
Bitches

It may not mean nothing to y'all
But understand nothing was done for me
So I don't plan on stopping at all
I want this shit forever man, ever man, ever man
I'm shutting shit down in the mall
And telling every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even planning to call
I want this shit forever man, ever man, ever man, ever man

Ever ever
Mr. West is in the building
Ain't no question who about to kill 'em
I used to have hood dreams
Big fame, big chains
I stuck my dick inside this life until that bitch came
And went hard all fall like the ball teams
Just so I can make it rain all spring
Y'all seen my story my glory
I had raped the game young
You can call it statutory
When a nigga blow up they gon' build statues of me
Old money Benjamin Button, what, nothing
Now it's super bad chicks giving me McLovin
You would think I ran the world like Michelle's husband
You would think these niggas know me when they really doesn't
Like they was down with the old me no you fucking wasn't
Um, you're such a fucking loser
He ain't even go to class Bueller
Trade the Grammy plaques just to have my granny back
Remember she had that bad hip like a fanny pack
Chasing the stardom will turn you to a maniac
All the way in Hollywood and I can't even act
They pull the cameras out and goddamn he snap
I used to want this thing forever y'all can have it back

It may not mean nothing to y'all
But understand nothing was done for me
So I don't plan on stopping at all
I want this shit forever man, ever man, ever man
I'm shutting shit down in the mall
And telling every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even planning to call
I want this shit forever man, ever man, ever man, ever man

OK, hello it's the Martian
Space Jam Jordans
I want this shit forever wake up and smell the garden
Fresher than the harvest
Step up to the target
If I had one guess then I guess I'm just New Orleans
And I will never stop like I'm running from the cops
Hop up in my car and told my chauffeur to the top
Life is such a fucking roller coaster then it drops
But what should I scream for this is my theme park
My mind shine even when my thoughts seem dark
Pistol on my side you don't wanna hear that thing talk
Let the king talk check the price and pay attention
Lil Wayne that's what they got to say or mention
I'm like Nevada in the middle of the summer
I'm resting in the lead I need a pillow and a cover
Shh, my foot's sleeping on the gas
No brake pads, no such thing as last

It may not mean nothing to y'all
But understand nothing was done for me
So I don't plan on stopping at all
I want this shit forever man, ever man, ever man
I'm shutting shit down in the mall
And telling every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even planning to call
I want this shit forever man, ever man, ever man, ever man

There they go, packing stadiums as Shady spits his flow
Nuts they go, Macadamian they go so ballistic, whoa
He can make them look like Bozos
He's wondering if he should spit this slow
Fuck no! Go for broke
His cup just runneth over, oh no
He ain't had him a buzz like this since the last time that he overdosed
They've been waiting patiently for Pinocchio to poke his nose
Back into the game and they know
Rap will never be the same as before
Bashing in the brains of these hoes
And establishing a name as he goes
The passion and the flame is ignited
You can't put it out once we light it
This shit is exactly what the fuck that I'm talking about when we riot
You dealing with a few true villains
Who stand inside of a booth truth-spilling
And spit true feelings, until our tooth fillings come flying up out of our mouths
Now rewind it!
Payback motherfucker for the way that you got at me how's it taste?
When I slap the taste out of your mouth with the bass so loud that it shakes the place
I'm Hannibal Lecter so just in case you're thinking of saving face
You ain't gonna have no face to save by the time I'm through with this place
So Drake

It may not mean nothing to y'all
But understand nothing was done for me
So I don't plan on stopping at all
I want this shit forever man, ever man, ever man
I'm shutting shit down in the mall
And telling every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even planning to call
I want this shit forever man, ever man, ever man, ever man

I want you to understand something
That when I come up in this bitch, I want the fans jumping
I want the fists pumping in the air, I don't look like a millionaire
But I feel like a million bucks, ladies won't ya fill your cups?
Shady's come to feel ya up, are you a D or a C cup?
You could even be a B, it's just me and D-R-E
You'll be in the ER, we are strapped with so much TNT
We may blow, no, not even CPR from the EMTs
Could help you to resuscitate, you busters must be flustered, wait
You can't cut the mustard
What's your problem, can't you bust a grape?
(Chkk-chk-chk) What's my name?
Shady came and just crushed the game
It's really not even fair to them
'Cause they pale in comparison
So much they might as well wear his skin
Don't you wish you could just share his pen?
'Cause this shit's getting embarrassin'
The fog is thick and the air is thin
'Cause he won't even let them try to breathe
La-dididi-dadada-didi
He makes it look so easy, girl, you just hit the lottery

Now this'll be the part of the song that they drop the needle on
And hell breaks loose
Try to restrain us, you can't contain us
We're still gonna make a stink no matter what we do
Everywhere we go it seems, we're looking for any excuse
To just cut loose
So this'll be the part of the song that they drop the needle on
And hell breaks loose

This is when shit hits the fan like it just splattered on Stan
This is the only moment that matters
Your homie rolled in with Mathers
Now chaos erupts, Em's in back, Dre's in the front
So do what we say at once, this song’s like a seance, it haunts
It makes them stay in a trance, no choice, they have to dance
It's like the playoffs, just making sure that we stay in the hunt
Take a day off of what? Man, you better lay off the blunts
You must be smoking something
You think I ain't smoking nothing, stay off my nuts
Now hit the floor, baby, time to wipe away all the rust
Shake all them cobwebs loose
Loosen up with a little bit of Grey Goose
Yeah, girl, shake that caboose
I don't wanna see you try to make no excuse
D-R-E is on the loose
A mongoose when it comes to the chronic use
You know I can't stand to lose
Me and my goons are like animals
We come through like a pack of wolves
And we came here to retract the roof
Yeah, man, ain't that the truth
Girl, your man's back in the booth
Definitely back up in this bitch
And this is when all hell breaks loose

Now this'll be the part of the song that they drop the needle on
And hell breaks loose
Try to restrain us, you can't contain us
We're still gonna make a stink no matter what we do
Everywhere we go it seems, we're looking for any excuse
To just cut loose
So this'll be the part of the song that they drop the needle on
And hell breaks loose

Now I know you're feeling discouraged
But, homie, just mark my words
I'm murderin' the flow, liquid courage, I'm fin' to blow
As soon as we hit the door, power surges head to toe
I'm sure to push it as far as words are meant to go
We're in the indigo Winnebago with tinted windows
Ferocious as we proceed to beat up the block wit' your ho
With speakers knocking, it's 3 o'clock
Me and Doc then proceed to drop E
And hop out the vehicle and knock on your door

Yeah, so let us in 'fore we huff and puff and we blow
We ain't bluffing for nothing, we'll knock the stuffing out you
Revenge is so sweet, move 'til you injure your feet
Yeah, move it or lose it, freak, move to the beat
Lose yourself indubitably
Pass up on that little cute chick right there?
That'd be pretty damn stupid to me
Born and raised in the CPT, yeah, Los Angeles, rules of the streets
Them haters hatin' on me, but I refuse to lose any sleep
Keep that deuce-deuce in the seat
Dre fall off? That's news to me

Now this'll be the part of the song that they drop the needle on
And hell breaks loose
Try to restrain us, you can't contain us
We're still gonna make a stink no matter what we do
Everywhere we go it seems, we're looking for any excuse
To just cut loose
So this'll be the part of the song that they drop the needle on
And hell breaks loose

Ahh! You sick asshole, let me go
Somebody please! Help!
Oh my God, please help me! Oh
"It fits perfect"

Better watch out, sucker, now I got you where I want ya
Onslaught coming and I'm packing in my lunch-a
Bunch of missile launchers and a bunch of contra–
Band, van full of ganja, now come on, jump
Man, stop moshin' Marshall; oh my God, ya
Doing the cha-cha and the Cucaracha with a quadra–
Plegic, boogying down to Frank Sinatra
Lindsay to the Lohan, lick it while you let me watch ya
Who'da knew the Buddha'd do to me what it's done?
Such cynicism when there's izm in my system
Blunt hypnotism, lift the spliff up to my lips, son
So much on my hands, I got to give my kids a fist bump
Christo–pher Reeves swimmin' in my swim trunks
"Mister – Help me" is what he said to me and then sunk
Women, skinning them and cutting them up in chunks
In comes the woman with cocoa butter skin, once

Once again, they call me Buffalo Bill
Buffalo Bill, Buffa-Buffalo Bill
Skin 'em up, hem 'em, sew 'em up in those kilts
Up in those kilts, uppa-up in those kilts
Man, you don't want to go up in those hills
Up in those hills, uppa-up in those hills
You better beware, stay clear of Buffalo Bill
Buffalo Bill, Buffa-Buffalo Bill

Always, you can see him lurkin' in the hallways
Carcasses of Caucasian females in his crawl space
How the hell did he fit 'em all into such a small place?
Hide 'em in the wall, well, how long will the drywall take?
Well, fuck it then, I got nothing but time, I'll wait
Until it dries, for the moment, I guess you're all safe
After I sand it and buff it, I guess that I'll paint
My chainsaw's out of gas, my regular saw ain't
Now here I come again, damn stomach rumbling
You can even hear the evil spirits coming from within
Someone's in the back of my damn house, rummaging
It's a girl, she looks pretty thin, but I want her skin
Vinn, on the hunt again, when will it ever end?
Evelyn, why you trying to fight? You will never win
Severin' legs, arms; damn, there goes another limb
Pull the lever then; trap door, death is evident

Once again, they call me Buffalo Bill
Buffalo Bill, Buffa-Buffalo Bill
Skin 'em up, hem 'em, sew 'em up in those kilts
Up in those kilts, uppa-up in those kilts
Man, you don't want to go up in those hills
Up in those hills, uppa-up in those hills
You better beware, stay clear of Buffalo Bill
Buffalo Bill, Buffa-Buffalo Bill

Now what you know about Buffalo Bill? Nothin', so chill
Fuckin' ho, you better fuckin' hold still
Make sure none of that lotion in the bucket don't spill
Cut 'em, gut 'em, and just get to stuffin' those girls
Man, I think she had enough of those pills
Sedate her, then I wait, I come back later
Just-a clutching those steel
Blades, baby, when I cut ya don't squeal
I hate the loud noises, I fuckin' told you!
I keep hearing voices like
"Wouldn't ya like to go and get your butcher knife
And push it right through her
While you put ya shish kebab skewers into her
Barbecue her, would you do to her what you usually do
To a girl who's skin's newer?"
(In a world of sin you are, this is turning into a
Torment tournament of sorts, Christmas ornament you are)
I'll be sure to Ginsu ya 'til there's no more skin to ya
Boo-yah! Who ya think you're fucking with?
Duck, because here he comes again

Once again, they call me Buffalo Bill
Buffalo Bill, Buffa-Buffalo Bill
Skin 'em up, hem 'em, sew 'em up in those kilts
Up in those kilts, uppa-up in those kilts
Man, you don't want to go up in those hills
Up in those hills, uppa-up in those hills
You better beware, stay clear of Buffalo Bill
Buffalo Bill, Buffa-Buffalo Bill

All aboard, okay, next stop, my basement… ha ha
I'll meet you down there

There once was a saying that I used to say
Back in the day when I met Dre
I used to sit and goof on the phone with my friend Proof
That if I went gold, I'd go right through the roof
He's say "What if you went platinum?" I'd just laugh at him
That's not happening, that I can't fathom
Eighty-some million records worldwide later
I'm living in a house with a fucking elevator

Haters getting mad, they done had enough of Shady
You slay me, nothing you say matters enough to touché me
Rappers try to play me, they use Hailie as a ukulele
Whoopsa-that-a-fucking-daisy
That's a no-no even she knows dada's fucking crazy
Fucking animal, cuckoo, bananas, fucking A B
Maybe it's because I never had a mother raise me
Fuck around and throw a baby at another baby
You may think it's 'cause of the way that I was brought up
But it's all caught up to me now, karma's in the waters
Every line I ever said has got me in a corner
You might think it doesn't creep upon ya, but it all does
You wouldn't listen man, I tried to warn ya when you started
Now your brain's all haunted 'cause of all the shit you thought of
Chainsaw slaughters turn your daughters into sawdust
I never thought it'd come to this, I ought to just be honest but

Sorry Lance, Mr. Lambert, and Aiken ain't gonna make it
They get so mad, when I call them both faggots
All these fucking voices in my head I can't take it
Someone shut that fucking baby up, 'fore I shake it
You're standing adjacent to Jason, slash, Leatherface, and
Together makes 'em a fucking bad combination
I lashed at the doctor in my last operation
Shoved the Wiener Schnitzel up his ass, hopped away
Somebody please stop the patient, get the cops to mace him
Homie, I'm the Scheiße, ask Doctor Dreizehn
I can't leave the game, I just can't walk away son
No, not a-now, not a chance, not today son
I can't believe I leave for one brief second
And you pussies queef all over the rap game, naked
And use a leaf to wipe up the crap stain, feck it
I'll just keep saying the same exact saying, check it

Elevator in my house, I'll smell ya later
I blew the fuck up, a hamster in a microwave-I
Thinking 'bout an escalator now, steps, I hate 'em
Told the neighbor step away, then I just pepper-sprayed 'em
Yeah, for every time you ride down the street
Or hideout, drive by my house and beep
Like now motherfucker, try now to sleep
Lie down fucker (baa), try countin' sheep
And you're tryna find out, why now there's beef?
Mace in your face bitch, cry now pussy
This is my house, all nine thousand feet
So you can suck my dick with Amy Winehouse's teeth
Then I shove 'em in the elevator, take 'em to the top
Stand above 'em, just to cut the fucking cable, let 'em drop
Walk an hour to the damn refrigerator, get a pop
While I let 'em fall all the way to the basement yelling stop!

You fucking son of a bitch, I can't believe this shit
This must be all that there is, this must be it
Fucking-A even got a bidet
To wash my ass after I shit with gold toilet paper
Dishwasher's so big, when I'm pissed off
I can just toss a flying saucer in it
The shit's awesome, yeah, fucking elevator
Living in a house with a fucking elevator

Yo, Dre, Man
Make my vocals sound sexy... woo!
Come on, man, come on, man, OK

It feels so wrong 'cause it feels so right
But it's all right, it's OK with me
I'll do my steps all by myself
I don't need nobody to play with me
But if you just give me a chance
I can put you in a trance the way I dance
But don't nobody wanna play with me
So I'm taking my ball and going home, home

I'm that guy, man, shove a diamond up my hind end
And crush it with my butt muscles while I cut vocals
Slut poke holes in ya shirt, jump in mud puddles
While I stomp mud holes in ya ass, girl, now let's cuddle
Blood curdlin', you're gurglin' on your blood, what'll
I do for my next trick? I'm feelin' wonderful
I think I might just do somethin' a little less subtle
Shove a fuckin' Tonka truck up a little kid's butthole
Feel the wrath of a psychopath slash ambassador
Of the Valentine's Day Massacre slash assassin
I slash her in the ass with a icicle
And leave her layin' in a blood bath while I
Put a catheter in and jump in the bath with her
In my Spider-Man mask, man
Just imagine the fun I can have with a strap-on
Stick it up Kim Kardashian's ass and make the bitch run a triathlon
Are those pistachios? Damn, I'd like to have some
Laying on the patio, man, rolling a fat one
Shady, drop the magic marker, put the cap on
Goddamn, man, are you that much of an asshole?

It feels so wrong 'cause it feels so right
But it's all right, it's OK with me
I'll do my steps all by myself
I don't need nobody to play with me
But if you just give me a chance
I can put you in a trance the way I dance
But don't nobody wanna play with me
So I'm taking my ball and going home, home

I'm like Houdini, tuck my teenie eenie weenie between each
One of my thighs and make it disappear like a genie
Make the shit disappear like Tara Reid in a bikini
Believe me, homie, you don't know the meaning of a meanie
They call me the fruit loop from Jupiter
I'm tryna maneuver the Hoover up in your poop chute
Don't move or ya might get it stuck so fuckin' far up in your uvula
You ain't gonna know what he was tryna do to ya gluteus
Totally tubular, sniffin' glue through a tube in the studio
Now who do ya think is more fruitier?
Wiener smothered in peanut butter, puttin' on a tube of ya
Eye shadow and man, it looked nice, you should've seen it, mother
I think I'll put a piece of art on my Visa card
Then I'll go beat Mischa Barton with a Cuisinart
Then mosey on over to Rosie O'Donnell's with McDonald's
Jump on her lap then watch The Sopranos

It feels so wrong 'cause it feels so right
But it's all right, it's OK with me
I'll do my steps all by myself
I don't need nobody to play with me
But if you just give me a chance
I can put you in a trance the way I dance
But don't nobody wanna play with me
So I'm taking my ball and going home, home

Shady, what are you doin' chewin' on a human?
Grab an aluminum bat, hit Heidi Klum in the back, boom!
And assumin' the fact that that dude's in the back room
Usin' the bathroom, vacuumin' a raccoon
Skewin' a rat, a cat screwin' a baboon
You shouldn't ask what is he doin' with that broom
You should be glad he ain't leave you full of stab wounds
You in a trance, I'm back doing my dance, ooh
But they're afraid I might get Sarah Palin by the hair
And make her wear a bathin' suit and take her parasailin'
Shady, why do you gotta pick on the lady for?
Why you make her read 84 bedtime stories to you in baby talk?
'Cause I'm scared, there's monsters under my bed
Kellie Pickler hid my juice box under my bassinet
No wonder my ass is wet, my diaper needs to be changed
You like graffiti, dyke? Well, I can pee-pee and write your name

It feels so wrong 'cause it feels so right
But it's all right, it's OK with me
I'll do my steps all by myself
I don't need nobody to play with me
But if you just give me a chance
I can put you in a trance the way I dance
But don't nobody wanna play with me
So I'm taking my ball and going home, home

Fine, nobody wants to play with me?
Fuck you then, bitch!
You guys are always mean to me anyways
All you ever do is rub gum in my hair and stuff
You guys are gonna make me... make me sad, I'm sad
I'm gonna cry... I'm crying
I'm going to tell my mom... Mom!

Yeah, girl
Can you hear that?
It's playing our song
Are you sleepy?
Take a nap
You're not afraid of the dark, are you?

You hear the beat as it makes you not wanna go to sleep
I knock on Dakota's door. It's locked so I go to creep
'Round the back with binoculars: not 'cause I wanna peep
But because I'm hungry. She smells like Tacos I wanna eat

Visions of hot chocolaty marshmallows are so sweet
With sugar plums
Oh, look, here comes Marshall! He's on your street!
He's placing hot smoldering charcoals beneath your feet
Now walk on 'em
He's dancing with carcasses cheek to cheek

Like a Thanksgiving turkey, a holiday ham
Cinnamon sprinkled on toast, strawberry marmalade jam
Flavor my favorite Graham crackers with JonBenét Rams'
I guess a modern-day Jack The Ripper is all that I am

My music box
'Cause when the lights are off, I see the girl's asleep
But I can hear you, my love. You keep calling me
Although we're worlds apart, you mean the world to me
So when you call, I come, I will answer

'Cause when the lights are off, I see the girl's asleep
I hear my music box playing a song for me
So, won't you twirl around and do a whirl for me?
And would you be my private little dancer?

I almost look comatose
Who wants to be sober gross?
I foam like a Doberman. Mouth open
I overdose
Put coke up my nostrils in both my holes and I plug my nose
My pupils quadruple in size. Eyes are so bugged. I know

I put on my mother's make-up, get naked and run around
Wavin' the gun around
I think I'm down to a hundred pounds
There's thunder
I wonder how come it rains but the sun is out
The devil's upset with his wife
They must be sluggin' it out

I must be buggin' the fuck out
But what the fuck about?
Voices are leading me up to the attic. I love my house
They pull and they tug my blouse
The sound of a music box comes from inside a toy chest
But what do I do? It's locked

I pick it and open it, but it's stuffed full of human parts
I dig 'til I find it, I wind it up and the tune just starts
It's playing a song so beautiful, and the room is dark
The moon is full. I smell a funeral. Guess I'll loom in the park

My music box
'Cause when the lights are off, I see the girl's asleep
But I can hear you, my love. You keep calling me
Although we're worlds apart, you mean the world to me
So when you call, I come, I will answer

'Cause when the lights are off, I see the girl's asleep
I hear my music box playing a song for me
So won't you twirl around, and do a whirl for me?
And would you be my private little dancer?

I'm fixated on asphyxiating and breakin' this little chick's neck like a Pixy Stix
The sick Satan-worshippin'
Bitches get horse-whippings
I'm in the back
Through the back door slipping through the crack
Leavin' the corpse drippin'

The mortician of love sent from above
Forced entry. The more wenchy the more stingy I become
Been doin' this for more than a quarter century I'm just numb
Am I dreamin'? Is it real? Someone pinch me on the buns

The time has come to tie her up
Gotta roll me the ladder
I've had enough of the chatter
Climb up to the window, look at her
Then climb in slow to shatter
Her brain matter
And batter
Her with the bat
A matter of fact that will splatter her
But before I do that, I'll have a chat to flatter her

Give her two compliments, back-to-back, like "Tabitha
I'm your secret admirer. I'm back to ravish you
So strong is your fight, but you're no match for Dracula."

Prolonging her plight, as I go back to stabbin' her
Dismember her limbs, simple as that, cadaver her
Zoom in with the lens then pan back the camera
Stand back 'cause here comes your man Jack. So, Pamela

My music box
'Cause when the lights are off, I see the girl's asleep
But I can hear you, my love, you keep calling me
Although we're worlds apart, you mean the world to me
So, when you call, I come, I will answer

'Cause when the lights are off, I see the girl's asleep
I hear my music box playing a song for me
So, won't you twirl around and do a whirl for me?
And would you be my private little dancer?

Yeah, boy
Dem better ring the alarm, boy
Dem know what's comin', boy
Buck! Buck! Buck! Haha
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Oh my God, fuckin' bomboclaat
I'm hard as Kenard, the little boy who shot Omar in The Wire
Tie a whore up with barbed wire, you're nothing but a bra, boy
I'm the real deal, and charbroil her on the bonfire
And bon voyage, bitch, I'm like Chef Boyardee
In this bitch, send a bomb to my mom's lawyer
I'm a problem for you, boy, you think you're Tom Sawyer
'Til I pull you out the fuckin' storybook and stomp on ya
Fuckin' fictitional characters and fairy tales
Prepare yourself for Captain America on Ferris wheels
But it ain't fiction, it's fact, boy, beware, it's real
Them lyrics you wield equal zero to a hero's shield
Mr. Fly-By-The-Seat-Of-His-Pants parasail
Fall, hit the trampoline, bounce and grab a pair of stilts
And I ain't wearin' zilch, zip, zero, nothing, no, nada
Like your father fuckin' your mother

Drop the bomb on 'em
Please don't drop the bomb on me
Shady, please, please don't drop the bomb on me
Drop the bomb on 'em
I don't want no doggone beef, see
Ain't no reason to sic the dogs on me
Drop the bomb on 'em
Please don't drop the bomb on me
Shady, please, please don't drop the bomb on me
Drop the bomb on 'em
I don't want no doggone beef, see
Ain't no reason to sic the dogs on me

Boy, I'm the Real McCoy, you little boys can't even fill voids
Party's over, kids, kill the noise, here come the killjoys
Me and Dre the steel alloys, the Rap Crown Royals
Who scalp cowboys, now, how that sound for you?
Yeah, boy, you know we're 'bout to put it down for you
So kick your shoes off in the foyer, have a sound voyage
And sayonara, see you fuckers tomorrow
Get some R&R and marinate in some marinara
And have a Coke and a smile, don't make me open a jar
Of whip-ass on ya, that's the last straw you're hopin' to draw
Yeah, you're fresher than most, boy, I'm just doper than all
Boy, I'm that boy, boy, them boys, them no up to par
I just show up, go up to the stage and blow up the spot
There ain't no boy who can do what I do, boy, I'm a star
Boy, I told you, boy, I'm a soldier boy, I'm Deshaun
Holton in this bitch, I'm the proof, boy, you're a fraud
I'll destroy you, boy, fuck around and blow you to sod
Oh my God, boy, you didn't go there, no, you did not
I got a whole storyboard for you, boy, you're the plot
You're gettin' got, whether you try to avoid it or not
Apology not accepted, boy, Detroit is a rock
We get to beefin', ain't no tellin' at what point it'll stop
All I got to do is point to the spot when the bomb drops
Boy, does it drop and when it does, boy, there's a problem

Drop the bomb on 'em
Please don't drop the bomb on me
Shady, please, please don't drop the bomb on me
Drop the bomb on 'em
I don't want no doggone beef, see
Ain't no reason to sic the dogs on me
Drop the bomb on 'em
Please don't drop the bomb on me
Shady, please, please don't drop the bomb on me
Drop the bomb on 'em
I don't want no doggone beef, see
Ain't no reason to sic the dogs on me

Boy, don't jinx yourself, boy, I'm Micheal Spinks with the belt
Stringer Bell, boy, my name rings bells for itself
I'm sick as hell, boy, you better run and tell someone else
Bringin' hell, boy, singin' telegrams and get dealt
And to that boy on them sedative meds who said he was better
I bet he never seen Freddy in a black and red little sweater
Back, better than ever, the cheddar shredder, the grater
The beef grinder, I'll settle vendettas a little later
Givin' haters incubators, think you made a mistake
By sayin' Shady was ghost, I ain't even close to the gate
You got one foot in the grave, just stay put and behave
I'm 'bout to turn this fuckin' place to Beirut in a day
So, hey, wouldn't you say I'm the shit? Couldn't agree with you more
If you were to say that my fuckin' shit doesn't stink
Shady-fuckin'-Aftermath, boy, the ship doesn't sink
It just floats in the fuckin' water 'til we fill up the tank

Drop the bomb on 'em
Please don't drop the bomb on me
Shady, please, please don't drop the bomb on me
Drop the bomb on 'em
I don't want no doggone beef, see
Ain't no reason to sic the dogs on me
Drop the bomb on 'em
Please don't drop the bomb on me
Shady, please, please don't drop the bomb on me
Drop the bomb on 'em
I don't want no doggone beef, see
Ain't no reason to sic the dogs on me

'Cause some things just don't change
It's better when they stay the same
Although the whole world knows your name
Some want a bigger stage
They came to see you spit your game, whoa
But it shouldn't be difficult to explain
Just why you came back again
You hate the fame, love the game
Cold as ice you remain, fuck 'em all
Tell 'em all eat shit, here we go again

Oh!
God damn!
Is it that time again already?
Haha, okay
Y'all don't look too happy to see me
Fuck, man
Don't everybody welcome me back at once
All right
Fuck y'all then!

You can get the dick, just call me the ballsack, I'm nuts
Michael Vick in this bitch, dog—fall back, you mutts!
Fuck your worms, you've never seen such a sick puppy
Fuck it, a sick duck, I want my duck sicked, mummy
And my nuts licked, gobble 'em up, trick, yummy
Bitch, you don't fuckin' think I know that you suck dick, dummy?
You'll get your butt kicked, fuck all that love shit, honey
Yeah, I laugh when I call you a slut, it's funny
Shorty, dance, while I diss you to the beat, fuck the words
You don't listen to 'em anyway, yeah, struck a nerve, sucker
Motherfucker, might as well let my lips pucker
Like Elton John, 'cause I'm just a mean cocksucker
The shit is on 'cause you went and pissed me off
Now I'm shittin' and pissin' on everybody
Give a fuck if it's right or wrong
So puff the Buddha, light a bong, but take a look at Mariah
Next time I inspire you to write a song—come on!

Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh
I'm as cold as the cold wind blows
When it snows and it's twenty below
Ask me why, man, I just don't know
No-no-no, no-no, no
I'm as cold as the cold wind blows
Blow-blow-blows
Blow-blow, blows, oh, oh-oh

Fuck it, I'm a loose cannon, Bruce Banner's back in the booth
Y'all are sittin' ducks, I'm the only goose standin'
I'll set the world on fire, piss on it, put it out
Stick my dick in a circle, but I'm not fuckin' around
Motherfucker, I'll show you pussy-footin'
I'll kick a bitch in the cunt 'til it makes a queef
And sounds like a fuckin' whoopee cushion
Who the fuck is you pushin'?
You musta mistook me for some sissy soft punk
Lookin' for some nookie or bosom
Go ahead, fuckin' hater, push me!
I told you ain't no fuckin' way to shush me
Call me a faggot 'cause I hate a pussy
Man the fuck up, sissy, G's up, all you gardeners freeze up
Put your hoes down, "Shady ease up!
Man, chill!" Nah, I can't, goddamn it, rap is a landfill
Drop the anvil, these are shoes that you can't fill
Shit, the day that happens the world will stop spinnin'
And Michael J. Fox'll come to a standstill
During an earthquake, urine in your face
'Cause you're fake Ow! What the fuck? That hurt, wait!
Ow! What the fuck? I just got struck by lightnin'
Alright then, I quit, God, I give up
Call it evil that men do
Lord, forgive me for what my pen do
"This is for your sins, I cleanse you
And you can repent, but I warn you
If you continue, to Hell I'll send you"
And just then the wind blew, and I said

Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh
I'm as cold as the cold wind blows
When it snows and it's twenty below
Ask me why, man, I just don't know
No-no-no, no-no, no
I'm as cold as the cold wind blows
Blow-blow-blows
Blow-blow, blows, oh, oh-oh-oh, oh

How long will I be this way? Shady until my dyin' day
'Til I hang up the mic and it's time for me to say
"So long," 'til then, I'll drop the fuckin' bombs
Like I missed the pass when I went long
If you don't like it, you can kiss my ass in a lint thong
Now sing along, slut this, slut that, learn the words to the song
"Oh, bitches don't like that," homie, I'll be nicer to women
When Aquaman drowns and the Human Torch starts swimmin'
Man, I'm a cold soul, I roll solo
So, don't compare me to them other bums over there
It's like apples to oranges, peaches to plums, yeah
I'm bananas, pussy, cut off the grapes and grow a pair
But I swear, you try to diss me, I'll slaughter you
I put that on everything, like everyone does with Auto-Tune
The last thing you want to do is have me spit out a rhyme
And say, "I was writing this and I thought of you," so

Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh
I'm as cold as the cold wind blows
When it snows and it's twenty below
Ask me why, man, I just don't know
No-no-no, no-no, no
I'm as cold as the cold wind blows
Blow-blow-blows
Blow-blow, blows, oh, oh-oh-oh, oh

I don't know, I don't know what caused
I don't know what caused me to be this way
I don't know, I don't know
But I'll probably be this way 'til my dyin' day
I don't know why I'm so, I'm so cold
Mean things I don't mean to say
I guess this is how you made me

Ayo, before I start this song, man
I just wanna thank everybody for being so patient
And bearing with me over these last couple of years
While I figure this shit out

Is anybody out there?
It feels like I'm talkin' to myself
No one seems to know my struggle
And everything I've come from
Can anybody hear me?
Yeah, I guess I keep talkin' to myself
It feels like I'm goin' insane
Am I the one who's crazy?
Yeah, whoa-whoa, whoa-whoa
Whoa-whoa, whoa-whoa, whoa-whoa
So why in the world do I feel so alone?
Nobody but me, I'm on my own
Is there anyone out there who feels the way I feel?
If there is, then lend me an ear
Just so I know that I'm not the only one

I went away, I guess, and opened up some lanes
But there was no one who even knew
I was goin' through growin' pains
Hatred was flowin' through my veins
On the verge of goin' insane
I almost made a song dissin' Lil Wayne
It's like I was jealous of him 'cause of the attention he was gettin'
I felt horrible about myself, he was spittin' and I wasn't
Anyone who was buzzin' back then coulda got it
Almost went at Kanye too
God, it feels like I'm goin' psychotic, thank God that I didn't do it
I'da had my ass handed to me, and I knew it
But Proof wasn't here to see me through it
I'm in the booth, poppin' another pill, tryna talk myself into it
"Are you stupid? You're gon' start dissin' people for no reason?
'Specially when you can't even write a decent punchline even? You're lyin' to yourself, you're slowly dyin'
You're denyin' your health is declinin' with your self-esteem
You're cryin' out for help"

Is anybody out there?
It feels like I'm talkin' to myself
No one seems to know my struggle
And everything I've come from
Can anybody hear me?
Yeah, I guess I keep talkin' to myself
It feels like I'm goin' insane
Am I the one who's crazy?
Yeah
So why in the world do I feel so alone?
Nobody but me, I'm on my own
Is there anyone out there who feels the way I feel?
If there is, then lend me an ear
Just so I know that I'm not the only one

Marshall, you're no longer the man, that's a bitter pill to swallow
All I know is I'm wallowing, self-loathing and hollow
Bottoms up on the pill bottle, maybe I'll hit my bottom tomorrow
My sorrow echoes in this hall though (Oh-oh, oh)
But I must be talkin' to the wall though, I don't see nobody else
(I guess I keep talkin' to myself)
But all these other rappers suck is all that I know
I've turned into a hater, I put up a false bravado
But Marshall is not an egomaniac, that's not his motto
He's not a desperado, he's desperate
His thoughts are bottled inside him
One foot on the brake, one on the throttle
Fallin' asleep with writer's block in the parkin' lot of McDonald's
But instead of feeling sorry for yourself
Do something 'bout it, admit you got a problem
Your brain is clouded, you pouted long enough
It isn't them, it's you, you fuckin' baby!
Quit worryin' 'bout what they do, and do Shady
I'm fuckin' goin' crazy

Is anybody out there?
It feels like I'm talkin' to myself
No one seems to know my struggle
And everything I've come from
Can anybody hear me?
Yeah, I guess I keep talkin' to myself
It feels like I'm goin' insane
Am I the one who's crazy?
Yeah
So why in the world do I feel so alone?
Nobody but me, I'm on my own
Is there anyone out there who feels the way I feel?
If there is, then lend me an ear
Just so I know that I'm not the only one

So I picked myself up off the ground
And fuckin' swam 'fore I drowned
Hit my bottom so hard I bounced twice, suffice, this time around
It's different, them last two albums didn't count
Encore, I was on drugs; Relapse, I was flushin' 'em out
I've come to make it up to you now, no more fuckin' around
I got somethin' to prove to fans, 'cause I feel like I let 'em down
So please accept my apology, I finally feel like I'm back to normal
I feel like me again, let me formally
Reintroduce myself to you for those of you who don't know
The new me's back to the old me
And homie, I don't show no signs of slowin' up
Oh, and I'm blowin' up all over
My life is no longer a movie, but the show ain't over, homos
I'm back with a vengeance, homie
Weezy, keep ya head up, T.I., keep ya head up
Kanye, keep ya head up, don't let up
Just keep slayin' them, rest in peace to DJ AM
'Cause I know what it's like
I struggle with this shit every single day, and um…

Is anybody out there?
It feels like I'm talkin' to myself
No one seems to know my struggle
And everything I've come from
Can anybody hear me?
Yeah, I guess I keep talkin' to myself
It feels like I'm goin' insane
Am I the one who's crazy?
Yeah
So why in the world do I feel so alone?
Nobody but me, I'm on my own
Is there anyone out there who feels the way I feel?
If there is, then lend me an ear
Just so I know that I'm not the only one

So there it is, damn
Feels like I just woke up or something
I guess I just forgot who the fuck I was, man
Ayo, and to anybody I thought about going at
It was never nothing personal
It was just some shit I was going through
And to everybody else, I'm back! (I'm back!)
Ha-ha (Ha-ha)

(Haha, yeah, haha)
You know, critics, man
Critics never got nothin' nice to say, man
You know, the one thing I notice about critics, man
Is critics never ask me how my day went
Well, I'ma tell 'em

Augh, yesterday my dog died
I hog tied a ho, tied her in a bow
Said: "Next time you blog, try to spit a flow."
You wanna criticize, dog? Try a little mo'
I'm so tired of this I could blow, fire in the hole
I'm fired up, so fire up the lighter and the dro
Better hold on a little tighter, here I go
Flows tighter, hot-headed as Ghost Rider
Cold-hearted as Spider-Man throwing a spider in the snow
So you better get lower than Flo Rida
Inside of a lowrider with no tires, in a hole
Why am I like this? Why is winter cold?
Why is it when I talk I'm so biased to the hoes?
Listen, dog, Christmas is off, this is as soft as it gets
This isn't golf, this is a blistering assault
Those are your wounds, this is the salt, so get lost
Shit, dissin' me is just like pissin' off the Wizard of Oz
Wrap a lizard in gauze
Beat you in the jaws with it, grab the scissors and saws
And cut out your livers, gizzards, and balls
Throw you in the middle of the ocean in a blizzard with Jaws
So sip piss like sizzurp through a straw
Then describe how it tasted like dessert to us all
Got the gall to make Chris piss in his drawers
Tickle him, go to his grave, skip him, and visit his dog

(You're on fire)
That's how you know you're on a roll
'Cause when you're hot it's like you're burning up everyone else's cold
(You're on fire)
Man, I'm so fuckin' sick
I got ambulances pullin' me over and shit
(You're on fire)
You need to stop, drop, and roll
'Cause when you say the shit to get the whole hip-hop shop to blow
(You're on fire) Yeah
(You're on fire) Yuh

I just put a bullshit hook in between two long-ass verses
If you mistook this for a song, look, this ain't a song
It's a warning to Brooke Hogan and David Cook
That the crook just took over, so book
Run as fast as you can, stop writing and kill it
I'm lightning in a skillet, you're a fuckin' flash in the pan
I pop up, you bitches scatter like hot grease splashing a fan
Mr. Mathers is the man, yeah, I'm pissed
But I would rather take this energy and stash it in a can
Come back and whip your ass with it again
Saliva's like sulfuric acid in your hand
It'll eat through anything, metal, the ass of Iron Man
Turn him into plastic
So for you to think that you could stand a fuckin' chance is asinine
Yeah, ask Denaun, man
Hit a blind man with a coloring book
And told him color inside the lines or get hit with a flying crayon
Fuck it, I ain't playin', pull up in a van
And hop out on a homeless man holding a sign sayin'
"Vietnam vet", I'm out my fuckin' mind, man
Kick over the can, beat his ass, and leave him nine grand
So if I seem a little mean to you
This ain't savage, you ain't never seen a brute
You wanna get graphic, we can go the scenic route
You couldn't make a bulimic puke
On a piece of fuckin' corn and peanut poop
Sayin' you sick, quit playin', you prick, don't nobody care
And why the fuck am I yellin' at air?
I ain't even talkin' to no one, 'cause ain't nobody there
And nobody will fuckin' test me
'Cause these hoes won't even dare
I'm wasting punchlines, but I got so many to spare
I just thought of another one that might go here
Nah, don't waste it, save it, psycho—yeah
Plus you got to rewrite those lines
That you said about Michael's hair (Whoops!)

(You're on fire)
That's how you know you're on a roll
'Cause when you're hot it's like you're burning up everyone else's cold
(You're on fire)
Man, I'm so I'm so hot
My motherfuckin' firetruck's on fire, homie
(You're on fire)
You need to stop, drop, and roll
'Cause when you say the shit to get the whole hip-hop shop to blow
(You're on fire) Yeah
Oh, shit (You're on fire)

You can sound the alarm, you can call out your guards
You can fence in your yard, you can hold all the cards
But I won't back down
Oh no, I won't back down, oh no

Cadillac Sevilles, coupe DeVilles
Brain-dead rims, yeah, stupid wheels
Girl, I'm too for real, lose your tooth-and-nail
Tryna fight it, try to deny it, stupid, you will feel
What I do, I do at will
Shootin' from the hip, yeah, boy, I shoot to kill
Half a breath left on my deathbed
Screamin', "F that!" – yeah, super-ill
Baby, what the deal? We can chill
Split a half a pill and a Happy Meal
Fuck a steak, slut, I'll cut my toes off
And step on the receipt 'fore I foot the bill
Listen, garden tool, don't make me introduce you
To my power tool, you know the fuckin' drill
How you douchebags feel knowin' you're disposable?
Summer's Eve, Massengill
Shady's got the mass appeal
Baby, crank the shit, 'cause it's your goddamn jam
You said that you want your punchlines a little more compact
Well, shorty, I'm that man
These other cats ain't metaphorically where I'm at, man
I gave Bruce Wayne a Valium
And said, "Settle your fuckin' ass down!
I'm ready for combat, man!"
Get it? Calm Batman, nah
Ain't nobody who's as bomb and as nuts
Lines are like Mom's CAT-scans
'Cause they fuckin' go bananas
Honey, I applaud that ass
Swear to God, man, these broads can't dance
Ma, show 'em how it's done
Spaz like a goddamn Taz, yeah

You can sound the alarm, you can call out your guards
You can fence in your yard, you can hold all the cards
But I won't back down
Oh no, I won't back down, oh no

Girl, shake that ass like a donkey with Parkinson's
Make like Michael J. Fox is in your drawers
Playin' with an etch-a-sketch
Bet you that you'll never guess
Who's knockin' at your door, people hit the floors
Yeah, tonight, ladies, you gon' get divorced
Girl, forget remorse, I'ma hit you broads
With Chris's force like you pissed him off
Talented with the tongue, ma'fucker
You ain't got a lick in yours
Hittin' licks like I'm robbin' liquor stores
Makin' cash registers shit their drawers
Think you spit the rawest?
I'm an uncooked slab of beef layin' on your kitchen floor
Other words, I'm off the meat rack
Bring the beat back, bring in two extension cords
I'ma measure my dick—shit, I need six inches more
Fuck, my dick's big, bitch, need I remind you
That I don't need the fuckin' swine flu to be a sick pig?
You're addicted, I'm dope
I'm the longest needle around here—need a fix, ock?
I'm the big shot—get it, dick-snots?
You're just small pokes, little pricks
Girl, you think that other prick's hot?
I'll drink gasoline and eat a lit match
Before I sit back and let him get hotter
Better call the cops on him quick, fast
Shady's right back on your bitch-ass
White trash with a half a six-pack in his hatchback
Trailer hitch attached to the back, dispatch

You can sound the alarm, you can call out your guards
You can fence in your yard, you can hold all the cards
But I won't back down
Oh no, I won't back down, oh no

Bitch, am I the reason that your boyfriend stopped rappin'?
Does a bird chirp? Does Lil' Wayne slurp 'zurp
'Til he burps and smoke purp?
Does a word search get circles wrapped around it
Like you do when I come through?
I'd like you to remind yourself of what the fuck I can do
When I'm on the mic
Oh, you're the kind of girl that I could take a likin' to
Psych! I'm spikin' you like a football
Been this way since I stood a foot tall
You're a good catch with a shitty spouse
Got a pretty mouth and a good jaw
Give me good brain, watch the wood-grain
Don't want no cum stain—bitch, you listenin'?
Tryin' to turn me down, slut, I'm talkin' to you
Turn me back up! Are you insane?!
Tryin' to talk over me in the car
Shut the fuck up while my shit's playin'!
I'm a shit stain on the underwear of life
What's the saying? Where there's thunder, there is lightning
And they say that it never strikes twice in the same place
Then how the fuck have I been hit six times
In three different locations on four separate occasions?
And you can bet your stankin' ass
That I've come to smash everything in my path
Fork was in the road, took the psycho path
Poison Ivy wouldn't have me thinkin' rash
So hit the dance-floor, cutie, while I do my duty
On this microphone; shake your booty, shorty!
I'm the shit—why you think Proof used to call me "Doody"?

You can sound the alarm, you can call out your guards
You can fence in your yard, you can hold all the cards
But I won't back down
Oh no, I won't back down, oh no

Yeah! Oh! Get up (Where my trash at?)
I said, get up
You know what happens when I'm around, man
Woo! Let's go
Better watch out now 'cause here we come
And we ain't stoppin' until we see the morning sun
So give us room to do our thing 'cause we ain't come to hurt no one
So everybody come and get up on the floor now and grab someone

Man, first of all; I'm a boss, I just want to get that across
Man, even my dentist hates when I floss
Pull up to the club in a Pinto like it's a Porsche
Garbage bag for one of the windows, spray-painted doors
With the flames on 'em, Michigan plates, and my name's on 'em
Baby, Shady's here, come and get him if you dames want him
But he ain't stupid so quit tryna run them games on him
He's immune to Cupid, why you tryna put your claims on him?
'Cause you won't do to me what you did to the last man
Now climb in back, try not to kick over the gas can
There's a half a gallon in it, that could be our last chance
We have of just gettin' home, now can I get that lap dance?
She's got a tattoo of me right above her ass, man
In the streets of Warren, Michigan, we call 'em tramp stamps
That means she belongs to me, time to put the damn clamps down
And show this hussy who's the man now get amped, dance

Now you can do this on your own
But everyone knows that no one likes to be alone
So get on the floor and grab somebody
Ain't nothin' but a white trash party (White trash party)
So let's have us a little bash
And if anyone asks, it ain't no one but us trash
You don't know, you better ask somebody
'Cause we're having a white trash party (White trash party)

Pull a fifth of Bacardi from out of my underwear
And walk around the party without a care, like a body without a head
Lookin' like a zombie from Night of the Living Dead
And tomorrow I'll probably still be too high to get out of bed
'Til I feel like I been hit with the sharp part of the hammer
I'm mixin' Hennessy and Fanta with Pepto and Mylanta
I shoot the gift like I'm hollering "Die Santa"
Missed the tree and hit Rudolph and two innocent bystanders
So quit tryna play the wall like you Paul
And get on the floor when the beat drops and stop stallin'
They call me the Stephon Marbury of rap, darlin'
'Cause as soon as they throw on some R. Kelly, I start ballin'
Makin' it rain for the ladies in the minis
But I'm not throwin' ones, fives, 10s, or even 20s
I'm throwin' quarters, nickels, dimes, pennies up at skinnies
Man, I do this for them bunnies up at Denny's from the North, East, and West
But when it comes to them trailers in them South parks
Muffle it, 'cause, homie, that hood's tighter than Kenny's
So, ladies, if your belly button's not an innie, then I'm outtie
Now hop in my minivan, let's get rowdy
Come on

Now you can do this on your own
But everyone knows that no one likes to be alone
So get on the floor and grab somebody
Ain't nothin' but a white trash party (White trash party)
So let's have us a little bash
And if anyone asks, it ain't no one but us trash
You don't know, you better ask somebody
'Cause we're having a white trash party (White trash party)

Now whether you're black, white, or purple, if you're misunderstood
But you don't give a fuck, you ain't doin' shit that you should
Long as you know you're up to evil and you're no damn good
Get on the floor, man, and rep your hood

Now honey, don't let them pricks trip, we should make a quick dip
And go do some doughnuts in the hospital parking lot, 'cause, girl—I got a sick whip
Kick the back window outta my Gremlin
Put two milk crates in the trunk, rip out the stick shift
And make a five-seater, I'll be damned if I feed a chick
It ain't like me to split a piece of dry pita
I be the S-L-to-the-I-M to the S-H-A-D-Y
And I don't need a tank top to be a wife beater
I'll rip a tree out the ground and flip it upside down
'Fore I turn over a new leaf, clown
I'll tell you now, I'm so raw, I still need to unthaw
You feel me, y'all? I shut the club down like Drake in the mall
But baby, a body like that's against the law
You the baddest little chain with the blades I ever saw
Coleslaw containers, empty straw wrappers and all
You got more junk in your trunk than I do in my car
Now get up

Now you can do this on your own
But everyone knows that no one likes to be alone
So get on the floor and grab somebody
Ain't nothin' but a white trash party
So let's have us a little bash
And if anyone asks, it ain't no one but us trash
You don't know, you better ask somebody
'Cause we're having a white trash party (White trash party)

I'm going through changes
I'm going through changes

Lately I really feel like I'm rolling for delf like Philly
Feel like I'm losing control of myself, I sincerely
Apologize if all that I sound like is I'm complaining
But life keeps on complicating, and I'm debating
On leaving this world this evening
Even my girls can see I'm grievin'
I try and hide it
But I can't. Why do I act like I'm all high and mighty
When inside I'm dying
I am finally realizing I need help
Can't do it myself. Too weak. Two weeks I've been having ups and downs
Going through peaks and valleys
Dilly-dallying 'round with the idea of ending the shit right here
I'm hatin' my reflection. I walk around the house tryna fight mirrors
I can't stand what I look like, yeah. I look fat, but what do I care?
I give a fuck. Only thing I fear is Hailie
I'm afraid if I close my eyes and I might see her
Shit

I'm going through changes
I'm going through changes

I lock myself in the bedroom, bathroom, nappin' at noon
Yeah, dad's in a bad mood, he's always snappin' at you
Marshall, what happened that you can't stop with these pills?
And you falling off with your skills?
And your own fans are laughin' at you?
It become a problem. You're too pussy to tackle, get up
Be a man, stand. A real man would've had this shit handled
Know you just had your heart ripped out and crushed
They say Proof just flipped out, homie just whipped out and bust
Nah, it ain't like Doody to do that
He wouldn't fuckin' shoot at nobody, he'd fight first
But dwellin' on it only makes the night worse
Now I'm popping Vics, Percs and Methadone pills
"Yeah, Em, tight verse. You killed it."
Fuckin' drug dealers hang around me like yes men
And they gon' do whatever I says when I says it
It's in their best interest to protect their investment
And I just lost my fuckin' best friend. So, fuck it, I guess then

I'm going through changes
(Don't know what I'm gonna do)
I'm going through changes
(But I just keep on going through changes)

My friends can't understand this new me
That's understandable, man, but think how bananas you'd be
You'd be an animal too, if you were trapped in this fame and caged in it like a zoo
And everybody's lookin' at you. What you want me to do?
I'm startin' to live like a recluse
And the truth is
Fame's startin' to give me an excuse
To be at a all-time low
I sit alone in my home theater watchin' the same damn DVD
Of the first tour. The last tour he was still alive
And it hurts. So, I fast forward. Sleepin' pills will make me feel alright
And if I'm still awake in the middle of the night
I'll just take a couple more. Yeah, you're motherfuckin' right
I ain't slowin' down for no one, I am almost homeward bound
Almost in a coma. Yeah, homie, come on dole 'em out
"Daddy, don't you die on me. Daddy, better hold your ground."
Fuck, don't I know the sound of that voice?
Yeah, baby hold me down

I'm going through changes
(Don't know what I'm gonna do)
I'm going through changes
(But I just keep on going through changes)

Wake up in the hospital, full of tubes, but somehow I'm pullin' through
Swear when I come back I'mma be bulletproof
I'mma do it just for Proof. I think I should state a few
Facts, 'cause I may not get a chance again to say the truth
Shit, it just hit me that what if I would not've made it through?
I think about the things I would've never got to say to you
I'd never get to make it right. So, here's what I came to do
Hailie, this one is for you, Whitney and Alaina, too
I still love your mother, that'll never change
Think about her every day. We just could never get it together
Hey, wish there was a better way for me to say it
But I swear on everything: I'd do anything for her on any day
There are just too many things to explain
When it rains, guess it pours. Yes, it does
Wish there wasn't any pain
But I can't pretend there ain't
I ain't placin' any blame
I ain't pointin' fingers. Heaven knows I've never been a saint
I know that it feels like we just pissed away our history
And just today I looked at your picture, almost if to say
"I miss you" subconsciously. Wish it didn't end this way
But I just had to get away. Don't know why
I don't know what else to say. I guess I'm

I'm going through changes
(Don't know what I'm gonna do)
I'm going through changes
(But I just keep on going through changes)

I'm not afraid (I'm not afraid)
To take a stand (to take a stand)
Everybody (everybody)
Come take my hand (come take my hand)
We'll walk this road together, through the storm
Whatever weather, cold or warm
Just letting you know that you're not alone
Holler if you feel like you've been down the same road (same road)

Yeah, it's been a ride
I guess I had to, go to that place, to get to this one
Now some of you, might still be in that place
If you're trying to get out, just follow me
I'll get you there

You can try and read my lyrics off of this paper before I lay 'em
But you won't take the sting out these words before I say 'em
'Cause ain't no way I'mma let you stop me from causing mayhem
When I say I'mma do something I do it
I don't give a damn what you think
I'm doing this for me, so fuck the world
Feed it beans, it's gassed up, if it thinks it's stopping me
I'mma be what I set out to be, without a doubt undoubtedly
And all those who look down on me I'm tearing down your balcony
No ifs, ands or buts, don't try to ask him why or how can he
From "Infinite" down to the last "Relapse" album
He's still shitting, whether he's on salary paid hourly
Until he bows out or he shits his bowels out of him
Whichever comes first, for better or worse
He's married to the game, like a "fuck you" for Christmas
His gift is a curse, forget the Earth, he's got the urge
To pull his dick from the dirt, and fuck the whole universe

I'm not afraid (I'm not afraid)
To take a stand (to take a stand)
Everybody (everybody)
Come take my hand (come take my hand)
We'll walk this road together, through the storm
Whatever weather, cold or warm
Just letting you know that you're not alone
Holler if you feel like you've been down the same road (same road)

Okay quit playing with the scissors and shit, and cut the crap
I shouldn't have to rhyme these words in a rhythm for you to know it's a rap
You said you was king, you lied through your teeth
For that fuck your feelings
Instead of getting crowned you're getting capped
And to the fans, I'll never let you down again, I'm back
I promise to never go back on that promise
In fact let's be honest
That last "Relapse" CD was "ehh"
Perhaps I ran them accents into the ground
Relax, I ain't going back to that now
All I'm trying to say is get back, click-clack, blow
'Cause I ain't playing around
There's a game called circle and I don't know how, I'm way too up to back down
But I think I'm still trying to figure this crap out
Thought I had it mapped out but I guess I didn't, this fucking black cloud
Still follows me around but it's time to exorcise these demons
These motherfuckers are doing jumping jacks now!

I'm not afraid (I'm not afraid)
To take a stand (to take a stand)
Everybody (everybody)
Come take my hand (come take my hand)
We'll walk this road together, through the storm
Whatever weather, cold or warm
Just letting you know that you're not alone
Holler if you feel like you've been down the same road (same road)

And I just can't keep living this way
So starting today, I'm breaking out of this cage
I'm standing up, I'mma face my demons
I'm manning up, I'mma hold my ground
I've had enough, now I'm so fed up
Time to put my life back together right now! (now)

It was my decision to get clean, I did it for me
Admittedly, I probably did it subliminally
For you, so I could come back a brand-new me you helped see me through
And don't even realize what you did, 'cause believe me you
I've been through the wringer, but they could do little to the middle finger
I think I got a tear in my eye, I feel like the king of
My world, haters can make like bees with no stingers
And drop dead, no more beef lingers
No more drama from now on, I wanna promise
To focus solely on handling my responsibilities as a father
So I solemnly swear to always treat this roof, like my daughters
And raise it, you couldn't lift a single shingle on it!
'Cause the way I feel, I'm strong enough to go to the club
Or the corner pub, and lift the whole liquor counter up
'Cause I'm raising the bar
I'd shoot for the moon but I'm too busy gazing at stars
I feel amazing and I'm...

I'm not afraid (I'm not afraid)
To take a stand (to take a stand)
Everybody (everybody)
Come take my hand (come take my hand)
We'll walk this road together, through the storm
Whatever weather, cold or warm
Just letting you know that you're not alone
Holler if you feel like you've been down the same road (same road)

Like a verbal seduction when
Seduction when I tell 'em girls on the floor
I don't know, man (Geh-geh-geh)
Just feels like we're a lot different (Right now)
(Girls on the floor) It kinda feels like (Like a verbal seduction when)
I'm on a whole different page right now than you (Girls on the floor)
It feels strange, but umm (Girls on the floor)
I guess it's kinda like, it's kinda like

I feel like I'm morphing into something that's so incredible that I'm dwarfing all competitors
Better get your girlfriend in check. It's psychological warfare. Endorphins I affect
Your self-esteem shatters as dialect comes blasting out your deck, "She loves me"
Such passion, you'd expect this sort of reaction from her. Yet, you strong arm
You're fucking corny. You try to turn your charm on
'Cause you just think you're Bishop, the Don Juan
But if you think that you're fucking with me, homie you're on one
I'm cocking my head back like, "Ed Lover. C'mon son
She's on my Johnson
She brings my name up constant."
Your boys are like, "She's fucking with dude. She wants him."
Homeboy, you better get a clue
She's on my dick 'cause I spit better than you
What you expect her to do?
How you expect her to act in the sack when she's closing her eyes, fantasizing of digging her nails in my back to this track

Seduction, seduce. Ain't nobody who's as good at what I do
(It's like a verbal seduction.)
'Cause one minute she loves you, the next she don't
She's been stolen from you
(It's like a verbal seduction.)
Seduction, seduce. Ain't nobody who's as good at what I do
'Cause one minute she loves you, the next she don't
She's been stolen from you
(It's like a verbal seduction.)

She's sitting there getting liquored up at the bar
She says it's quicker to count the things that ain't wrong with you than to count the things that are
There's a seven-disc CD changer in her car, and I'm in every single slot, and you're not. Aww
I'm the logo on that Dallas Cowboy helmet: a star
And I'm not about to sit back and just keep rhyming one syllable. Naw
Switch it up, and watch them haters not give it up 'cause they're just not good enough
But I'm not giving up 'til I get my respect, and I won't stop 'til I get enough
'Cause I'm not living up to my own expectations. Aww
That hater alarm is sounding off, that Obama took the bomb from my name. Aww
So quit crying that I took your dame, homie she's my dame. Aww
You sadly mistaken if you thinking that I'm not on my game, boy
And things just ain't been the same since the day that I came forth
You wear your heart on your sleeve. I sport that white tank boy
But you got a hard on for me. What you hollering my name for?
It's your bitch on my dick. Ain't my dang fault. Man, I can't call it

Seduction, seduce. Ain't nobody who's as good at what I do
(It's like a verbal seduction.)
'Cause one minute she loves you, the next she don't
She's been stolen from you
(It's like a verbal seduction.)
Seduction, seduce. Ain't nobody who's as good at what I do
'Cause one minute she loves you, the next she don't
She's been stolen from you
(It's like a verbal seduction.)

It's like we're playing lyrical tug of war with your ear. You hear it girl, come here
Put your ear up to the speaker, dear, while I freak this world premier seducing her
Loosen up with a little freestyle that'll wait, am I losing you? Am I making you look bad?
Well I got news for ya, homie, you losing her. Oh wait, she don't like when I spit it fast
Am I trying to show her how? Let me slow it down some. It's still gonna be a blow out
You're gonna wanna throw out your whole album
Rummage through the shit, and try to salvage something to see if you can save any of it
Punk, but none of it's fucking with me. Prick, you really feeling that bullshit?
You think you killing them syllables. Quit playing. These beats ain't nothing to fool with
They call me Fire Marshall. I shut the shit down
Your entire arsenal is not enough to fuck with one round
I am also the opposite of what you are like
You are microcosm of what the fuck I am on the mic
I am awesome and you are just awestruck. She's love-stricken
She's got her jaw stuck, from sucking my dick. Aww, fuck

Seduction, seduce. Ain't nobody who's as good at what I do
(It's like a verbal seduction.)
'Cause one minute she loves you, the next she don't
She's been stolen from you
(It's like a verbal seduction.)
Seduction, seduce. Ain't nobody who's as good at what I do
'Cause one minute she loves you, the next she don't
She's been stolen from you
(It's like a verbal seduction.)

Love
Don't hurt me
Don't hurt me
No more
Young Money
No more
Love

Throw dirt on me and grow a wildflower
But it's "fuck the world", get a child out her
Yeah, my life a bitch, but you know nothing about her
Been to hell and back, I can show you vouchers
I'm rolling Sweets, I'm smoking sour
Married to the game but she broke her vows
That's why my bars are full of broken bottles
And my night stands are full of open Bibles, uh
I think about more than I forget
But I don't go around fire expecting not to sweat
And these niggas know I lay 'em down, make your bed
Bitches try to kick me while I'm down: I'll break your leg
Money outweighing problems on a triple beam
I'm sticking to the script, you niggas skipping scenes, uh
Be good or be good at it
Fucking right I've got my gun, semi-Cartermatic
Yeah, put a dick in their mouth, so I guess it's "fuck what they say"
I'm high as a bitch: up, up and away
Man, I'll come down in a couple of days
OK, you want me up in a cage, then I'll come out in beast mode
I got this world stuck in the safe, combination is the G-code
It's Weezy motherfucker, Blood gang and I'm in bleed mode
All about my dough but I don't even check the peep-hole
So you can keep knocking but won't knock me down
No love lost, no love found

It's a little too late to say that you're sorry now
You kicked me when I was down
But what you say just (don't hurt me)
That's right bitch (don't hurt me)
And I don't need you (no more)
Don't wanna see you (no more)
Ha, bitch you get (no love)
You showed me nothing but hate
You ran me into the ground
But what comes around goes around (yeah, yeah)
I don't need you (don't hurt me)
That's right (you don't hurt me)
And I don't need you (no more)
Don't wanna see you
Ha, bitch you get (no love, no, no love, no, no love, no, no love)
Ha, bitch you get (no love, no, no love, no, no love)
And I don't need you (no more)
Get em

I'm alive again
More alive than I have been in my whole entire life
I can see these people's ears perk up as I begin
To spaz with the pen, I'm a little bit sicker than
Most
Shit's finna get thick again
They say the competition is stiff
But I get a hard dick from this shit, now stick it in
I ain't never giving in again
Caution to the wind, complete freedom
Look at these rappers, how I treat them
So why the fuck would I join 'em when I beat 'em
They call me a freak 'cause
I like to spit on these pussies 'fore I eat them
Man get these whack cocksuckers off stage
Where the fuck is Kanye when you need him?
Snatch the mic from him, bitch I'mma let you finish in a minute
Yeah that rap was tight
But I'm 'bout to spit the greatest verse of all time
So you might wanna go back to the lab tonight and um
Scribble out them rhymes you were gonna spit
And start over from scratch and write new ones
But I'm afraid that it ain't gonna make no difference
When I rip this stage and tear it in half tonight
It's an adrenaline rush to feel the bass thump
From the place all the way to the parking lot, fellow
Set fire to the mic and ignite the crowd
You can see the sparks from hot metal
Cold-hearted from the day I Bogarted the game
I so started to rock fellow
When I'm not even in my harshest
You can still get roasted 'cause Marsh is not mellow
'Til I'm toppling from the top I'm not gonna stop
I'm standing on my Monopoly board
That means I'm on top of my game and it don't stop
'Til my hip don't hop anymore (shit)
When you're so good that you can't say it
'Cause it ain't even cool for you to sound cocky anymore (shit)
People just get sick 'cause you spit
These fools can't drool or dribble a drop anymore
And you can never break my stride
You never slow the momentum at any moment I'm about to blow
You'll never take my pride
Killing the flow, slow venom and the opponent
Is getting no mercy, mark my words
Ain't letting up, relentless
I smell blood, I don't give a fuck: keep giving them hell
Where was you when I fell and needed help up?
You get no love

It's a little too late to say that you're sorry now
You kicked me when I was down
But what you say just (don't hurt me)
That's right bitch (don't hurt me)
And I don't need you (no more)
Don't wanna see you (no more)
Ha, bitch you get (no love)
You showed me nothing but hate
You ran me into the ground
But what comes around goes around (around)
I don't need you (don't hurt me)
That's right (you don't hurt me)
And I don't need you (no more)
Don't wanna see you
Ha, bitch you get (no love, no, no love, no, no love, no, no love)
Ha, bitch you get (no love, no, no love, no, no love)
And I don't need you (no more)
Bitch, you get (no love)

We touch I feel a rush
We clutch it isn't much
But it's enough to make me wonder what's in store for us
It's lust, it's torturous
You must be a sorceress 'cause you just
Did the impossible
Gained my trust don't play games it'll be dangerous
If you fuck me over
'Cause if I get burnt I'mma show you what it's like to hurt
'Cause I've been treated like dirt before you
And love is "evol"
Spell it backwards I'll show you

Nobody knows me I'm cold
Walk down this road all alone
It's no one's fault but my own
It's the path I've chosen to go
Frozen as snow I show no emotion whatsoever so
Don't ask me why I have no love for these motherfucking ho's
Bloodsucking succubuses, what the fuck is up with this?
I've tried in this department but I ain't had no luck with this
It sucks but it's exactly what I thought it would be
Like trying to start over
I got a hole in my heart, but some kind of emotional roller coaster
Something I won't go on 'til you toy with my emotions, so it's over
It's like an explosion every time I hold you, I wasn't joking when I told you
You take my breath away
You're a supernova... and I'm a

I'm a space bound rocket ship and your heart's the moon
And I'm aiming right at you
Right at you
Two hundred fifty thousand miles on a clear night in June
And I'm aiming right at you
Right at you
Right at you

I'll do whatever it takes
When I'm with you I get the shakes
My body aches when I ain't
With you I have zero strength
There's no limit on how far I would go
No boundaries, no lengths
Why do we say that until we get that person that we think's
Gonna be that one and then once we get 'em it's never the same?
You want them when they don't want you
Soon as they do feelings change
It's not a contest and I ain't on no conquest for no mate
I wasn't looking when I stumbled onto you must've been fate
But so much is at stake what the fuck does it take
Let's cut to the chase
'Fore a door shuts in your face
Promise me if I cave in and break and leave myself open
That I won't be making a mistake
Cause I'm a...

I'm a space bound rocket ship and your heart's the moon
And I'm aiming right at you
Right at you
Two hundred fifty thousand miles on a clear night in June
And I'm aiming right at you
Right at you
Right at you

So after a year and six months, it's no longer me that you want
But I love you so much it hurts
Never mistreated you once
I poured my heart out to you
Let down my guard swear to God
I'll blow my brains in your lap
Lay here and die in your arms
Drop to my knees and I'm pleading
I'm trying to stop you from leaving
You won't even listen so fuck it
I'm trying to stop you from breathing
I put both hands on your throat
I sit on top of you squeezing
'Til I snap your neck like a Popsicle stick
Ain't no possible reason I could think of to let you walk up out this house
And let you live
Tears stream down both of my cheeks
Then I let you go and just give
And before I put that gun to my temple
I told you this

And I would have did anything for you
To show you how much I adored you
But it's over now
It's too late to save our love
Just promise me you'll think of me every time you look up in the sky and see a star 'cause I'm a...

I'm a space bound rocket ship and your heart's the moon
And I'm aiming right at you
Right at you
Two hundred fifty thousand miles on a clear night in June
And I'm so lost without you
Without you
Without you

Yeah, you know, technically
I'm not even really supposed to be here right now
So fuck it, might as well make the most of it
(Amen) Yeah! Ha-ha
(Amen) Feels good
(Amen) Woo!
(Amen) Guess I'm lucky
(Amen) Some of us don't get a second chance
(Amen) But I ain't blowin' this one
(Amen) Nah, man, ha-ha
(Amen) Shit, I feel like I can do anything now

Who can catch lightning in a bottle, set fire to water
Comin' out the nozzle on a fire hose, flyer than swatters?
Cinderella Man, Cinderella Man
Cinderella Man, Cinderella Man
Smash an hourglass, grab the sand, take his hands and cup 'em
Spit a rhyme to freeze a clock, take the hands of time and cuff 'em
Cinderella Man, Cinderella Man
Cinderella Man, Cinderella Man
There's a storm comin' that the weatherman couldn't predict
I start to bug, prick, you better flee, 'cause I get ticked
It's a wrap, I was down, when I was down I was kicked
I got up, I'm back to punch you to the ground, you're tricked
It's a trap, fuck my last CD, the shit's in my trash
I'll be goddamned if another rapper gets in my ass
I hit the gas and I spit every rap as if it's my last
You can die in the blink of an eye, so bat your eyelashes
And keep winkin' and blowin' kisses 'cause you're flirtin' with death
I'm destroyin' your livelihood, I ain't just hurtin' your rep
I catch a flow and get goin', no remorse I'm showin', ain't slowin'
For no one, knowin' there's nothin' you can do about it
Zero in on my target like a marksman, the target is you
I shut your lane down, took your spot, parked in it too
Arsenic flow, lighter fluid, saliva—what can you do?
Go get your crew to hype you up, stand behind you like, "Woo!"
That boy's hot enough to melt Hell, burn Satan too
Fry his ass and put his ashes back together with glue
So you can hate him, he don't blame you, frankly, he would too
This game could ill afford to lose him, how 'bout you?

Now guess who? (Hey) Here's a clue (Hey)
He came to the ball in his wife beater, lost his Nike shoe
It's in your ass (Hey), he's in your ass, he's all up in your psyche too (Hey)
Now (Hey) what's his name?

Cinderella Man, Cinderella Man (Hey)
Cinderella, Cinderella Man (Hey)
Cinderella Man (Hey, hey)
If I had a time machine
I'd be Cinderella Man
Cinderella Man, Cinderella Man
Cinderella Man, Cinderella Man
Music is my time machine
So call me
Cinderella Man, Cinderella Man
Cinderella Man, Cinderella Man

Fuck catchin' lightning, he struck it, screamed, "Shut up!" at thunder
Then flipped the world upside down and made it rain upward
Cinderella Man, Cinderella Man
Cinderella Man, Cinderella Man
Rewound the future to the present, paused it, don't ask how
Fuck the past, motherfucker, he's the shit right now, he's
Cinderella Man, Cinderella Man
Cinderella Man, Cinderella Man
Cinderella man, Cinderfella Shady Dane, came
To wrap the game up in cellophane, raise hell, from Hell he came
But didn't come to bore you with the Cinderella story
Nor did he come to do the same old can't afford to be
A lame-o in this day and age and at this stage of the game
Mediocrity can no longer be allowed to fly, so say bye
To the old, H-I to the new, que será
Consider it his last hurrah, the coup de grâce, raise 'em high
In the sky, keep 'em up, time to bring the place alive
Thanks for bein' patient, I won't make no more mistakes, shit, my
Potato's baked, homie, the veggies on my plate can fly
My filet is smokin' weed—yeah, faggot, the stakes are high
Shit, I ain't even s'posed to be here by the grace of God
The skin on my teeth and a hair on my nuts, I skated by
Now y'all are on thin ice with ankle weights, I'd hate to lie
How fuckin' irritated are you? How much in your face am I?
And ain't shit you can do but fear it, Proof is here in spirit
And I'm his spittin' image, I mirror it when I stand near it
Your pussy lyric, I "cunt" hear it
Who forms pyramids and raps circles around square lyricists?

Who? (Hey) Here's a clue (Hey)
He came to the ball in his wife beater, lost his Nike shoe
It's in your ass (Hey), he's in your ass, he's all up in your psyche too (Hey)
Now (Hey) what's his name?

Cinderella Man, Cinderella Man (Hey)
Cinderella, Cinderella Man (Hey)
Cinderella Man (Hey, hey)
If I had a time machine
I'd be
Cinderella Man, Cinderella Man
Cinderella Man, Cinderella Man
Music is my time machine
So call me
Cinderella Man, Cinderella Man
Cinderella Man, Cinderella Man

Too late for the other side
Caught in a chase
25 to life
Too late for the other side
Caught in a chase
25 to life
(Yeah)
Too late
(I can't keep chasing 'em
I'm taking my life back)
Caught in a chase
25 to life

I don't think she understands the sacrifices that I made
Maybe if this bitch had acted right I would've stayed
But I've already wasted over half my life I would've laid
Down and died for you I no longer cry for you
No more pain bitch you
Took me for granted took my heart and ran it straight into the planet
Into the dirt I can no longer stand it
Now my respect I demand it
I'mma take control of this relationship
Command it, and I'mma be the boss of you now goddammit
And what I mean is that I will no longer let you control me
So you better hear me out this much you owe me
I gave up my life for you, totally devoted to you while I've stayed
Faithful all the way this is how I fucking get repaid?
Look at how I dress fucking baggy sweats, go to work a mess
Always in a rush to get back to you I ain't heard you yet
Not even once say you appreciate me I deserve respect
I've done my best to give you nothing less than perfectness
And I know that if I end this I'll no longer have nothing left
But you keep treating me like a staircase it's time to fucking step
And I won't be coming back so don't hold your fucking breath
You know what you've done no need to go in depth
I told you, you'd be sorry if I fucking left
I'd laugh while you wept
How's it feel now, yeah, funny ain't it? You neglected me
Did me a favor although my spirit free you've set
But a special place for you in my heart I have kept
It's unfortunate but it's

Too late for the other side (Yeah)
Caught in a chase
25 to life
(Can't take no more)
Too late for the other side
Caught in a chase
25 to life

I feel like when I bend over backwards for you all you do is laugh
'Cause that ain't good enough you expect me to fold myself in half
'Til I snap
Don't think I'm loyal
All I do is rap
How can I moonlight on the side?
I have no life outside of that
Don't I give you enough of my time?
You don't think so, do you?
Jealous when I spend time with the girls
Why I'm married to you still? Man, I don't know
But tonight I'm serving you with papers
I'm divorcing you
Go marry someone else and make 'em famous
And take away their freedom like you did to me
Treat 'em like you don't need them and they ain't worthy of you
Feed 'em the same shit that you made me eat
I'm moving on forget you oh
Now I'm special? I didn't feel special when I was with you
All I ever felt was this
Helplessness
Imprisoned by a selfish bitch
Chew me up and spit me out
I fell for this so many times
It's ridiculous
And still I stick with this
I'm sick of this but in my sickness and addiction
You're addictive as they get
Evil as they come vindictive as they make 'em
My friends keep asking me why I can't just walk away from
I'm addicted
To the pain, the stress, the drama
I'm drawn in so I guess I'm a mess
Cursed and blessed
But this time I
Ain't changing my mind
I'm climbing out this abyss
You screaming as I walk out that I'll be missed
But when you spoke of people who meant the most to you
You left me off your list

Fuck you hip-hop
I'm leaving you, my life sentence is served bitch
And it's just

Too late for the other side
Caught in a chase
25 to life
(I'm gone, man)
Too late for the other side
Caught in a chase
25 to life
Too late
Caught in a chase
25 to life

Yeah, haha, you feel that, baby?
Yeah, I feel it too, damn
(I'm so bad, I'm so good that I'm so bad)
You know, I'm so glad we could spend this time together
(I guarantee I'll be the greatest thing you ever had)
You see, I'm not as crazy as you thought I was, am I?
('Cause you ain't never met nobody like me
And you ain't gonna wanna fuck nobody else again)

I'm the American Dream
I'm the definition of white trash ballin'
I'm right back on 'em with a err-chick-err, chicka-chick
I can't call it, same shit, different toilet
Oh, you got a nice ass, darling
Can't wait to get you into my Benz, take you for a spin
What you mean we ain't fuckin'? You take me for a friend?
Let me tell you the whole story of Shady's origin
You'll be sorry if you slam my Mercedes door again
Now, it all started with my father
I must've got my pimpin' genes from him
The way he left my momma
I'm a rolling stone, just like him, word to Johnny Drama
Keep my entourage with me, baby, I'll make a promise
There ain't nobody as bomb as
Me, I'm as calm as the breeze
I'm the bee's knees, his legs, and his arms
I'm a superstar, girl, I'm ready for you, mama
Why you think the only thing I got on is my pajamas?

I'm so bad, I'm so good that I'm so bad
I guarantee I'll be the greatest thing you ever had
'Cause you ain't never met nobody like me
And you ain't gonna wanna fuck nobody else again
I'm so bad, I'm so good that I'm so bad
I guarantee I'll be the greatest thing you ever had
'Cause you ain't never met nobody like me
And you ain't gonna wanna fuck nobody else again

I'm equivalent to a shot of Cuervo
First I'll kiss your navel, work my way down
Baby, you can lay down on the table
But you may wanna find somethin' more stable
I told you I ain't foolin' from the gate
This ain't the first day of April
But thank you for stayin', April
I'ma make you learn to appreciate me, differentiate me
From these phony, little fishy and sissy fake Gs
Skip over the "huggy bear," and all the "kissy face," please
Initiate phase three, missy, now service me
Take another shot of Jäger, shakin' so nervously
Take your time, baby, oh, you're the bomb, baby
Oh, you're doing that even better than your mom, lady
I told you why I'm Shady, you didn't listen now, did ya?
Relax, woman, you know that I'm only kiddin' with ya
Got a twisted sense of humor, it's warped, but I didn't hit ya
I think you're finally startin' to get the picture, I'm just

I'm so bad, I'm so good that I'm so bad
I guarantee I'll be the greatest thing you ever had
'Cause you ain't never met nobody like me
And you ain't gonna wanna fuck nobody else again
I'm so bad, I'm so good that I'm so bad
I guarantee I'll be the greatest thing you ever had
'Cause you ain't never met nobody like me
And you ain't gonna wanna fuck nobody else again

Call me dynamite, dynamite, dynamite, soul
Call me dynamite, dynamite, dynamite, soul
I can hold you in the morning
But in the evening I gotta go
'Cause I'm on to the next girl
And the next girl I kind of like, oh

I got you caught up in the rapture, make you recapture
The feelings you had for your last boyfriend before he slapped ya
You never wanted someone so bad, you're
Sweatin', but if I'm what you wanted
Why'd you panic when I grabbed ya?
Girl, don't be so frantic, I'm just a hopeless romantic
Don't try to fight the feeling of somethin' that's so organic
You can't ignore it, so don't, just stand before it
Just drop them panties to the floor, let's get to camcordin'
Damn, shawty, I told you this was bound to happen
Soon as you wrote your number on the napkin
I was bound to work a number on your back
And throw your spine out of alignment
My love has got you so blind that
You couldn't pick Amy Winehouse out of a line-up
So stop at the store, pick a pint up
Let's get the pineapple Schnapps going, no one will knock
'Cause I'ma hang a sign up saying "Don't Disturb"
Shawty, I'm so superb
I say the right things, don't I spit the dopest words?

I'm so bad, I'm so good that I'm so bad
I guarantee I'll be the greatest thing you ever had
'Cause you ain't never met nobody like me
And you ain't gonna wanna fuck nobody else again
I'm so bad, I'm so good that I'm so bad
I guarantee I'll be the greatest thing you ever had
'Cause you ain't never met nobody like me
And you ain't gonna wanna fuck nobody else again

Dynamite, dynamite, dynamite, soul
Dynamite, dynamite, dynamite, soul
I can hold you in the morning
But in the evening I gotta go
'Cause I am on to the next girl
And the next girl I kind of like, oh

I'm so bad, I'm so good that I'm so bad
I guarantee I'll be the greatest thing you ever had
'Cause you ain't never met nobody like me
And you ain't gonna wanna fuck nobody else again

Dr. Dre
2010
Light years ahead of you

I can almost taste it
This shit makes no sense to me
What does it all mean?
I can almost taste it
I can almost see it
This shit makes no sense to me
What does it all mean?
I can almost taste it

Yeah, can't stop now
(I can almost taste it.)
This may be the last chance I get to be famous
(I just wanna be famous)

You dream of trading places
I have been changing faces
You cannot fill these shoes
There is too much to lose
Wake up behind these trenches
You run around defenseless
There is too much to lose
You cannot fill these shoes
I just wanna be famous
But be careful what you wish for

I stuck my dick in this game like a rapist
They call me Slim Roethlisberger
I go berserker than a fed-up post-office worker
I murk her with a Mossberg
I'm pissed off, get murdered
Like someone took a ketchup squirter
Squirted a frankfurter
For a gangster you sure did shit your pants
When you saw the chainsaw get to waving
Like a terrible towel
How thangs turn around
When his fangs come out
Get your brains blown out
That's what I call blowing your mind
When I come back
Like nut on your spine
I'm the thumb tack
That you slept on, son
Now here I come screaming "Attack!"
Like I just stepped on one
Low on the totem 'til he showed 'em
Defiance, giant scrotum
He don't owe them bitches shit
His britches, he out growed 'em
He's so out cold he's knocked out at the South Pole
And nobody fucks with him
Rigor mortis and post mortem
He's dying of boredom
Take your best rhymes, record 'em
To try to thwart him
He'll just take your punch lines and snort 'em
Shit-stained drawers
You gon' fuck with a guy who licks the blades of his chainsaws
While he dips 'em in PF Chang's sauce
Game's up, homie, hang it up like some crank calls
You think I'm backing down?
You must be out of your dang skulls
I'm almost famous

You dream of trading places
I have been changing faces
You cannot fill these shoes
There is too much to lose
Wake up behind these trenches
You run around defenseless
There is too much to lose
You cannot fill these shoes
I just wanna be famous
But be careful what you wish for

I'm back for revenge
I lost a battle that ain't happening again
I'm at your throat like strep
I step, strapped with a pen
Metaphors wrote on my hand
Some are just stored in my memory
Some I wrote on a napkin
I do what I have to to win
Pullin' out all stops, any who touch a mic prior's
Not even Austin Powers, how the fuck are they Mike Myers
And tell that psycho to pass the torch
To the whacko 'fore I take a shit in his Jack-O-Lantern
And smash it on his porch
Now get off my dick
"Dick"'s too short of a word for my dick
Get off my antidisestablishmentarianism, you prick
Don't call me the champ; call me the space shuttle destroyer
I just blew up the Challenger, matter fact I need a lawyer
I just laced my gloves with enough plaster
To make a cast, beat his ass naked and peed in his corner like Verne Troyer
Ya'll are Eminem backwards, you're Meni Mes
See he's in a whole 'nother weight class
He slugs, you're BBs, you're bean-bag bullets
You're full of it; you were dissin' his CDs
Laughed at Infinite, now he's back like someone pissed in his Wheaties
No peace treaties, he's turned into a beast
His new Slim Shady EP's got the attention of the mighty D. R. E
He's almost famous

You dream of trading places
I have been changing faces
You cannot fill these shoes
There is too much to lose
Wake up behind these trenches
You run around defenseless
There is too much to lose
You cannot fill these shoes
I just wanna be famous
But be careful what you wish for

Now there he goes in Dre's studio cuppin' his balls
Screaming the wood off the panelling
And cussing the paint off the walls
Spewing his hate to these haters, showing no love for these broads
He ain't given 'em shit, he says he'll pinch a penny so hard
He'll leave a bruise on the bronze so dark you can see the mark
When it scars, 'til Abraham Lincoln is screaming out, "Awww!"
His metaphors and similes ain't similar to them, not at all
If they don't like it, they can all get fucked instead of sucking him off
They can go get a belt or a neck tie, to hang themselves by
Like David Carradine they can go fuck themselves and just die
And eat shit while they at it
He's fucking had it, he's mad at the whole world
So go to hell and build a snowman, girl
The bullies become bullied, and pussies get pushed
Then they better pull me, take me back to 9th grade to school me
'Cause I ain't looking back, only forward, this whole spot blowing
Who could have known he'd grow to be a poet and not know it?
And while I'm being poetic let me get historic and raise the bar
Higher than my opinion of these women's been lowered
So bear witness to some biblical shit
As a cold wind blowing
This world ain't gonna know what hit it
He did it, he made it, he's finally famous

I can't tell you what it really is
I can only tell you what it feels like
And right now, there's a steel knife in my windpipe
I can't breathe but I still fight while I can fight
As long as the wrong feels right it's like I'm in flight
High off her love, drunk from her hate
It's like I'm huffing paint and I love her the more I suffer, I suffocate
And right before I'm about to drown, she resuscitates me
She fucking hates me and I love it
"Wait! Where you going?"
"I'm leaving you!"
"No you ain't. Come back"
We're running right back
Here we go again
It's so insane 'cause when it's going good, it's going great
I'm Superman with the wind at his back, she's Lois Lane
But when it's bad it's awful, I feel so ashamed I snap
"Who's that dude?"
"I don't even know his name"
I laid hands on her, I'll never stoop so low again
I guess I don't know my own strength

You ever love somebody so much you can barely breathe when you're with 'em
You meet and neither one of you even know what hit 'em
Got that warm fuzzy feeling
Yeah, them chills used to get 'em
Now you're getting fucking sick of looking at 'em
You swore you'd never hit 'em; never do nothing to hurt 'em
Now you're in each other's face spewing venom in your words when you spit them
You push, pull each other's hair, scratch, claw, bit 'em
Throw 'em down, pin 'em
So lost in the moments when you're in them
It's the rage that took over
It controls you both
So they say it's best to go your separate ways
Guess that they don't know you 'cause today that was yesterday
Yesterday is over, it's a different day
Sound like broken records playing over but you promised her
Next time you'd show restraint
You don't get another chance
Life is no Nintendo game
But you lied again
Now you get to watch her leave out the window
Guess that's why they call it window pane

Now I know we said things, did things that we didn't mean
And we fall back into the same patterns, same routines
But your temper's just as bad as mine is
You're the same as me
When it comes to love you're just as blinded
Baby, please come back
It wasn't you, baby it was me
Maybe our relationship isn't as crazy as it seems
Maybe that's what happens when a tornado meets a volcano
All I know is I love you too much to walk away though
Come inside, pick up your bags off the sidewalk
Don't you hear sincerity in my voice when I talk
Told you this is my fault
Look me in the eyeball
Next time I'm pissed, I'll aim my fist at the drywall
Next time? There won't be no next time!
I apologize even though I know it's lies
I'm tired of the games I just want her back
I know I'm a liar
If she ever tries to fucking leave again
I'mma tie her to the bed and set this house on fire
I'm just gonna

The days are cold, livin' without you
The nights are long, I'm growin' older
I miss the days of old, thinkin' about you
You may be gone, but you're never over

If Proof could see me now, I know he'd be proud
Somewhere in me deep down, there's something in me he found
That made him believe in me, now no one can beat me now
You try, it'll be them doors on Dre's Phantom, believe me, clowns
That means "suicide," homie, you'll never throw me
Off of this course, blow me! Bitch, I do this all for the sport only
But I want it all, I'm not just talkin' awards, homie
And the ball's in my court and it's lonely
On top of the world, when you're the only one
With the balls in your shorts
To leave their jaws on the floors with no remorse
'Member that when they get to doggin' you boy, homie
So y'all can just get to bloggin' about bologna
I'm not gonna stop, the saga continues, no stoppin' the force, Obi
I'm moppin' the floors with 'em, I keep tryna pass it, but they keep on
Droppin' the torch and it won't be long 'til this sport is O-V-
-E-R, just Blaze and me, we are knockin' on doors and no, we
Ain't pumpkins on Halloween, but we'll show up on your porch, so be
Careful what you say, there ain't no punks over here, so follow me
Through the fog like I'm S-N-double-O-P, let me guide you through the smoke, G
If only I wasn't travelin' down this road by my lonely
No one who knew me like you will ever know me
I don't think you understand how much you meant to me

The days are cold, livin' without you
The nights are long, I'm growin' older
I miss the days of old, thinkin' about you
You may be gone, but you're never over

And it don't stop, oh-oh
And it don't quit, oh-oh
And it don't stop, oh-oh
And it don't quit, oh-oh
And I miss you, oh-oh
I just miss you, oh-oh
I just miss you, oh-oh
Homie, I'll never forget you, no

For you I wanna write the sickest rhyme of my life
So sick it'll blow up the mic, it'll put the "dyna" in "mite"
Yeah, it'll make the dopest MC wanna jump off a bridge and shit himself
Tap dancin' all over the beat, it'll jump off the page and spit itself
Guess that the best thing I can do right now, Doody, for you is to rep
So I'm gonna fuck 'til I die, yeah, I'ma do it to death
And instead of mournin' your death, I'd rather celebrate your life
Elevate to new heights, step on the gas and accelerate, I'ma need two mics
'Cause the way that I'm feelin' tonight, everything I can just do right
There's nothin' that I can do wrong, I'm too strong and I'm just too hype
Just finish the rhyme and I bust it, excuse the corny metaphor
But they'll never catch up to all this energy that I've mustered
So God, just help me out while I fight through this grievin' process
Tryna process this loss is makin' me nauseous
But this depression ain't takin' me hostage, I've been patiently watchin'
This game, pacin' these hallways, you had faith in me always
Proof, you knew I'd come out of this slump, rise from these ashes
Come right back on their asses and go Mike Tyson on these bastards
And I'ma show 'em, blow 'em out the water, slaughter 'em, homes
I'ma own so many belts, only place they can hit me is below 'em
Homie, I know I'm never gonna be the same without you
I never woulda came in this game, I'm goin' insane without you
Matter fact, it was just the other night had another dream about you
You told me to get up, I got up, I spread my wings and I flew
You gave me a reason to fight, I was on my way to see you
You told me, "Naw, Doody, you're not!"; layin' on that table, I knew
I was gonna make it; soon as you said, "Think of Hailie" I knew
There wasn't no way that I was ever gonna leave them babies; and Proof
Not many are lucky enough to have a guardian angel like you
Lord, I'm so thankful, please don't think that I don't feel grateful, I do
Just grant me the strength that I need for one more day to get through
So, homie, this is your song, I dedicate this to you
I love you, Doody

The days are cold, livin' without you
The nights are long, I'm growin' older
I miss the days of old, thinkin' about you
You may be gone, but you're never over

And it don't stop, oh-oh
And it don't quit, oh-oh
And it don't stop, oh-oh
And it don't quit, oh-oh
And I miss you, oh-oh
I just miss you, oh-oh
I just miss you, oh-oh
Homie, I'll never forget you, No

(You don't own me. Don't try to change me)
Nah man
Not quite finished yet

Girl, I think
You just might've tried to pull a motherfucking fast one, I'm mad
You just hurt my goddamn feeling, and that was the last one I had
Does this look like an arcade? Tryna play games?
See this saw blade? See the silhouette of a stalker
In your walk-way? Better co-operate
Or get sautéed and rotisseried while you're hog-tied
MCs get so quiet you can hear a motherfucking dog whistle when I walk by
'Colt Seavers' on a mule, stunting on that ass like the fucking Fall Guy
I don't gas my Mercedes after midnight, I treat it like a Mogwai
'Cause it will turn into a Gremlin and run over kids, women and men
Vrinn-vrinn! Motor's so big you can fit a midget in his engine
Bitch, give me them digits, why you're cringin'
Not by the hair on my chinny-chin-chin
Will I spend-spend even ten cents on you, since when
Do you think it's gonna cost me a pretty penny?
Shit, if I think a penny's pretty
Just imagine how beautiful a quarter is to me
Eenie meenie miney mo
Catch an Eskimo by his toe (you don't own me)
While he's trying to roll a snowball
But don't make him lose his cool
If he hollers better let him go ya'll, 'cause (you don't own me)

Now here we go go go

Get up! Baby, get a move on, like a U-Haul
You can rack your brain like pool balls
You won't ever think of this shit
Yeah, honey you called?
Well, here I come, Havoc on the beat, I wreak it
Evil I see, hear and speak it
Lady, put your money on Shady
Fuck that other weak shit
Put your eggs in the same basket
You can count every motherfucking chicken 'fore it hatches
'Cause, you can bet your ass that we gon' get it crackin'
Like the Kraken and Titans when they're clashin'
Get your brains bashed in so bad
You gon' have Kurt Cobain askin'
To autograph a bloodstained napkin
Unfashionable and 'bout as rational
As a rash on a fag's asshole
Now let's take that line, run it up the flag pole with Elton
See if he's cool with it
Don't stand there and look stupid at me, bitch
I ain't in the mood for this shit
Get my dick, Google it 'til it pops up
Ya'll are so motherfucking full of shit that you're stopped up
Me, I'm always shitting diarrhea of the mouth
'Til your speakers crap out [*fart*] "Ohp, what?"
Girl, you got a hot butt like a lit cigarette "Chik-Chigarette"
But you won't get a hot fudge sundae from me
So do not strut my way, slut! Because

You don't own me

Here we go go go

And now that I got your panties in a bunch
And your bowels in an uproar
I'mma show you why I came
So you stop asking me what the fuck for
Now look you little slut, cunt, whore I know you want more
Bitch, it's time to put the 'Math' back in the Mathers
'Cause I'm a fucking problem, run boy!
Every flow got it mastered
So every last word that you fucking fags heard
Comes straight from the fish's ass, yeah
In other words I'm a bass-turd!
Looking at me like I killed Kenny
Gas in the tank, yeah still plenty
No morals are instilled in me
So remorse I really don't feel any
Eat your heart out, Hannibal
Understandable why you're jealous, fucking animal
I got cannibal magnetism, can't resist him now, can ya hoe?
Shady, I don't understand your flow
Understand my flow?
Bitch, I flow like Troy Polamalu's hair, boy
Don't you dare try to follow or compare, boy
I'm raw, you ain't even medium-rare
Stay the fuck outta my hair, boy!
You can look, you can stare and point
But you can't touch I'm too clairvoyant
I don't get it man, is there a void
All this weak shit, what am I steroids?
Well, bitch, I'm back with some shit for that ass
And your trunk, elephant hemorrhoids

And remember boys

You don't own me

Now here we go go go

Thank you for coming out
Hope you enjoyed the show
'Til next time

Ha ha

Peace!

Aw man
Yeah…
You ever be in the club man, you get in a fight
And people that you don't even know jump in?

You feel like you wanna hit something, your fist clenches, you're pissed
You just wanna get someone with shit, jump on this
You're 'bout to get your shit pushed in, I'm just inches away
From splitting your shit wide open, no stitches can save
You'll die with your eyes open, you hope this isn't the way
You end up going out, but I guess it just is I'm afraid
Razors, scissors and blades make Jason say, "Isn't this great?"
On-lookers participate in this ass-kicking debate
That's starting to take place in the middle of the street
Little did you know there'd be an all-out brawl soon as you heard this beat
Emergency personnel rush to the murder scene but it's too late
It's absolute pandemonium
Whisked away in an ambulance is your fate
Nothing nobody told you when you left the house today
Could've made you anticipate
Such an ass-whipping, okay
'Til the anger dissipates
You get punched in the face, reciprocate, come on

So what the deal ridaz?
Would you excuse me while I feel my nuts?
My balls are feeling a mighty big now
I might just have to dig down and pull 'em through my britches
I said, so what the deal ridaz?
Would you excuse me while I feel my nuts?
My balls are feeling a mighty big now
I might just have to dig down and pull 'em through my britches

You step in the place with enough misplaced anger to catch a case
Anxious to get in some shit, got your gangstas all with your ladies
You better go get your mace 'cause Shady said so
You may wanna pick up the radio and bang it against your face
That's how fuckin' rowdy you feel, now you still wanna grill?
If you don't wanna get the shit beat out of you, chill
'Cause if you doubt me you will, yeah got me a pill, found me a thrill
I got a couple of drinks here, and I'm bound to refill
Girl howdy, how do you feel ma?
This cocksucker did not spill my drink, oh hell nah
He must be trying to kill my buzz
I will not budge, so what the deal ridaz?
Now here they all come and they got your back in like 2 seconds flat
And that's probably a record, yeah, you wasn't expecting that
'Cause they want in on the act, there's a cognac bottle
We snuck it in 'cause the beer that they was serving here was only tap
I'm biting, I fight dirty, you might get kicked in the nuts
You're frightened like "This guy might hurt me"
You're quite certain he's nuts, I've hit myself in the face harder
Play smarter, you may start her over, you need a chainsaw to
Dig your way out or go powder your nose
Pussy the louder you yell the harder I slap the shit outta you hoes
You set it off faggot so now how do you 'spose
We settle it, hit me in the nose, we'll see how it goes

So what the deal ridaz?
Would you excuse me while I feel my nuts?
My balls are feeling a mighty big now
I might just have to dig down and pull 'em through my britches
I said, so what the deal ridaz?
Would you excuse me while I feel my nuts?
My balls are feeling a mighty big now
I might just have to dig down and pull 'em through my britches

It's sheer hustle, I bob, weave, deflate your beer muscles
We're tussling, the crowd's starting to cheer us and
Adrenaline's rushing through us just like a geyser gushing
Too much Budweiser in my blood, I'm strangling your windpipe for nothing
My signature's ligature marks, look at you all
Big with your remarks 'til I swing an icepick at your heart
At least that's what it feels like when I pick you apart
And dig at ya, and break you down like the bitch that you are
The predicament starts when I throw a brick at your car
The pain inflicted upon you is so sick it's bizarre
Shit this is almost ridiculous, addictive as far
As having me wanna rip out your fricking ligaments, ah
You hit like a bitch, you scratch me with your nails for that
You catch an open hand slap like a female like bap
In fact I'll have the crowd smacking you themselves
Where's D12? I don't feel like doing this by myself, come on

So what the deal ridaz?
Would you excuse me while I feel my nuts?
My balls are feeling a mighty big now
I might just have to dig down and pull 'em through my britches
I said, so what the deal ridaz?
Would you excuse me while I feel my nuts?
My balls are feeling a mighty big now
I might just have to dig down and pull 'em through my britches

Yeah, what the deal?
I'm feeling hard as hell right now homie
I almost feel... Invincible and shit
Ay Dre! You got me feeling like I can't be touched right now fool
I'm unstoppable
Damn

Ladies and gentlemen, make some noise!
Aww shit, yeah
Y'all ready to get this shit started or what?
Aight, well I brought some friends with me too

Now I ain't back just for the sake of just saying I'm back
I could relax but I'd rather stack ammo on tracks
Couple Xanax, light a couple wax candles then black
Out and relapse 'til I yack Jack Daniels and 'gnac
Burp bubbles, attitude's immaturing
Double shot of Bacardi, party, vision is blurring
Whoa-oh, I can't see shit, my words get to slurring
Uh-oh! You can call me R. Kelly now, you're in trouble!
What's occurring before, after and during the show
Has no bearing on the bad news I'm bearing, whoa
What is it, wordplay? No I'm pushing you out the door
So suck my dick on the couch if you wanna cushion the blow
Now stomp your fuckin' feet 'til you get to squishing a hoe
It's pandemonium standing know when you see him, oh
Damn baby you look good, you're giving me wood
You should, pull over like a sweat-shirt with a hood
It's neck work, get her polly on, you and me both
Break bread while I'm copping over this game to pinch a loaf
Now homie who's your favorite pain in the ass?
Who claims to be spitting the same flames as me? I'm Kanye when he crashed
In other words I got the hood on smash like I stepped on the gas
Destroyed the front end, deployed the damn airbags from the dash
Went through 'em and laughed
Came back an hour after the accident and bit a goddamn Jawbreaker in half!
So stop faking the funk and start shaking your ass
Slaughterhouse in the house with the Caucasian of rap
And Just Blaze on the track, what's the fuck's more amazing than that?
Slut, answer me that, Royce where you at?

I'm right here Fire Marshall, verbal pair of pliers I pry apart you
Lump on your head designed by a bar stool
Designed by a cartoon
Before I need to be hired, Jimmy Io' fire Marshall
The 9 tucked against the lining
I pull it out and flip your partner upside-down like y'all are a couple 69ing
It's like Rick James is shooting up your house nigga!
Fuck yo' couch nigga!
You're screaming, "Fuck the world!" with your middle finger up
While I'm over here shoving my dick in a hole in the mud
My bitch, know I'm perfectly fit, for murder
Because I murdered her, so you can call me Nickel to O.J. to Glove
I got a Posse of Insane Clowns
Blow your brains on your opposite ear, and ask you how your brain sounds
Bad, Evil, we go Alfred E. Neuman mad cerebral
You on your last burrito!
(What that mean Nickel?) It's a wrap if you eating
Get a beat then terrorize that bitch like I'm Middle Eastern
Slaughterhouse on fire, nobody touching that
Good day and good night, Ortiz yo where the fuck you at?

I'm right here in my Nike Airs, Buzz Light-years
Ahead of my mic peers, quite scary to look at a nightmare
Where my book at? I write fear in the heart of you tight squares
I harbor the art, of you nice wear
It's type weird 'cause that made me hotter than my dear
Uncle Al's breath after polishing off his ninth beer
Homie chill, listen, I swear
I'm God, I give tracks a Holy-feel, and they bite ears
I'm right here, why wouldn't I be?
Just waiting to be hooked to IV as Mumm-Ra's
Well when you look at my pee
And this joint, no exception, so just point a direction
And record the pig's oink, when I rip his intestine
This isn't just an infection
This won't go away with penicillin injections
Millions of questions arose after they did an inspection, what I exhibit
Seems to be non-contagious yet anybody can get it
Aw shiddit, I did it again, when I liddift this pen
I emitted this phlegm, this time it's alongside Emiddinem
So tell a friend to tell a friend write a disgusting hook
Jump in shark water and swim, yo where the fuck is Crook?

I'm right here letting the shottie pop, quick as a karate chop
Get your body shot, get your top chopped, like a lollipop
Call it Maserati drop, in the body shop
Get your mommy knocked, and your Uncle Tommy molli-wopped
I take your life to the ninth inning
A knife in the gunfight, I love it, me and my knife winning
I laugh when you fall, the shit'll be funny
I'll buy my bitch a new ass and watch her sit on my money
Man, all the bitches holla they wanna drop my britches
Then jaw on my dick and swallow, leave drawers in this Impala
I ball like Iguodala, I bear more arms than six koalas
As soon as I draw, get sent to Allah
Bilinguist don, I kill with the tongue, I'm Atilla the Hun
I'm Genghis Khan, I'm a genius spawn
I pillage your village for fun, an egregious con
A syllable gun, real as they come, Long Beach Saddam!
Slaughterhouse equals swine flu, are South flying
We do it to try to do without trying
(Slaughterhouse!) 'Cause to us it's so easy
Where's Jumpoff Joe Beezy?

Yeah, yeah, I get it
I run this rap shit, now guess who's back
You thought I left you, now why would I do that? (1, 2, 3)

They keep on sayin' the same rappers are the best
Jay-Z and Kanye West, maybe they're just tryna distract it
From the fact that I'm comin' back
Or maybe it's cause I ain't black, maybe it's because of that
Maybe it's because I'm the highest sellin' artist in rap
While I'm sittin' back in my office jackin' off to my plaques
I'm still sick, how can I be sick this long
And I'm still alive, Magic Johnson arise
I thrive on makin' my opponents think that I've died
That's when I just pop up outta nowhere, oh yeah, there we go there
Damn I forgot how much money he got
On the beach of Saint-Tropez, but your man don't lay
In the sun cause I don't tan, I burn, blood clot
When you gonna learn how much money we've earned
How does it feel to know I came in this game at 25
And coulda retired at 29 in my 20′s still
And Fif' here to lick on that Coca-Cola shit
And he ain't even gotta look at coke to even hold a brick
No more, oh boy, goddamn did he score
To go from sellin' bags to bottles right out the store
And Shady hit the box office man, he knocked the socks off us
My ex-wife is set for life, you profitless cocksuckers
So stay the fuck off us, we make pay
I'm just a super easy modest MC, okay?
Til I hear the word has been, that's when I start spazzin'
Smart asses, kiss a smarter ass then
I'm the best thing that ever happened to rap, bastards
I'm a blonde Dre, now gimme Kanye's glasses!

Obie the person that came up introverted
'Cause of nervousness, that was solely the only verdict
It was worth it 'cause he changed, became so observant
Servin' such of a purpose
If you knew him earlier in his days, it's like a different version
So much hurtin' and pain gave him game for certain
That's why it's curtains in this murder, if you get him worked up
I'm so assertive on these motherfuckers acting tougher
Had enough of isolatin' myself in a room
Writing poems and songs, doing the same in school
Now look what he became, a fool
'Cause he learned how to sustain his tool and obtain fame from you
Livin' hard but still Julliard
A god walks and ain't spend a day in the pew
Regardless of this I draw visual, pictures when a nigga vents
So welcome to the art department

I stimulate the brain, mimic, emulate the sane
Cynics keep on thinkin' it's a fuckin' gimmick when it ain't
Clinically insane, brain is on Venus, up Uranus
Label me a genius if you ever seen us you would say
"He may seem as though he's plain normal" if you ever meet him
Greet him with a shake, see he ain't as mean as what they say
See the thing is maybe he can't always think of things to say
So he's vague, so they mistake him for bein' crazed
You part ways, your impression of him changed
You don't think he's strange, you turn around and tell him; "Peace and thanks"
You catch him flippin' you off, with his pants down
Hands around his scrotum, tuckin' his fuckin' penis between his legs

It's all psychologic, why am I so maniacal?
Am I a psycho or some kind of psychotic shtick?
Or am I truly psychotic? Or my molecules just diabolical?
'Cause biologically, I defy logic, by golly, haul me off on a trolley
Probably want a quack, or I'm back on that whacky tobacca
I'ma step away from crack, Obie smacked the shit out of me
I'm so slap happy, man, snap me back to reality
I'm a walkin' art gallery, a science museum
Elephantitis of the nuts, you'd probably die if you see them
I pull them out, they hit the ground and probably crack the cement
I need an ambulance, I can't just put them back in my pants (Help me!)

There's no need to say shit, you already know
The question is just how far will this go?
How far will he take it?
And when will he stop?
Shady man, I done told you once homie to ease up
But you just won't listen will ya? Nah, I guess not
You just can't can ya? Man, I can't stand ya
You're rotten, what you plottin' for us?
Man, when are you gonna let up?
I guess things are gonna get much worse 'fore they get better

Holy Toledo, it's Angelina Jolie, amigo
She told me "Yo, Shady just hand your penis to me, I'll deep throat,"
And Brad if you try to stand between us then we're gonna see, bro
Who was a fantasy, I don't mean to damage your ego
You faggots wanna 'rassle?
I shove a fucking jar of Vaseline up inside your asshole
And rope it shut with a lasso
Couple of crushed Lexapro broken up with the capsule or Paxil
Just in case I ain't dope enough with the raps, though
Coke is cut with tobacco, smoke it up, then go wacko
This is what happens when you mix a coconut with Tabasco
Shady let go, the ho has been choked enough, let her ass go
Not till Jessica Simpson lets go of the tuna casserole
I used to love her hooters now Carmen Electra's cuter
Strap an extension cord to her arm and electrocute her
I'm off my fucking meds, but I'm on an electric scooter
I might just scoot by and shoot my mom in the neck with rugers
Spit in Jason's face while I vomit on Freddy Kruegar
They can't even get Jeffrey Dahmer to pet the cougar
Now I'm gone get the rectal thermometer, get the lubra-
Cation and get the patient some Darvocet to chew 'cause

There's no need to say shit you already know
The question is just how far will this go
How far will he take it?
And when will he stop?
B.o.B I done told you once homie to easy up, jeez
There's no need to say shit you already know
The question is just how far will this go
Cause I will never lay down
And I will never let up
I guess things are gonna get much worse 'fore they get better

With the soul of a Shaman
I'll eat a beat then vomit
Like a bulimic woman with an uneasy stomach
I pass by people on the street they seem like sheep and zombies
Stiffer than a therapeutic pair of jeans you run in
So can you hear me coming
Eminem this beat is absolutely disgusting
It's probably got diseases on it
I'm just being honest, I can see the comments
I can see the evolution as we creep up on it
I put that music in your veins like a needle junkie
Shit I just do this for the haters, I don't need the money
I'm diarrhea on the track so it needs plunging
Somebody please tell these girls to release my undies
Nobody really understands my language
I find it complicated just to hold a conversation
But still I got a whole lot of patience
Sittin' back watching Earth from my Space station

There's no need to say shit, you already know
The question is just how far will this go?
How far will he take it?
And when will he stop?
Shady man, I done told you once homie to ease up
But you just won't listen will ya? Nah, I guess not
You just can't can ya? Man, I can't stand ya
You're rotten, what you plottin' for us?
Man, when are you gonna let up?
I guess things are gonna get much worse 'fore they get better

Oh my gosh I put Natasha Bedingfield in a washer
Watch it go from rinse to spin cycle
It's like I got ya hypnotized and I forgot ya
My God, ya psychologically fucked
Michael would like an apology, what?
Tell that psycho to stick a Tyco truck and a white tricycle up his butt
And glue the seat of bicycle to his nuts
I'm as cold as a motherfucking icicle I'm a nut
I ain't nuttin' nice, man I like to pull knives and I like to cut
The poster addict for post traumatic stress
I guess this is the most dramatic I've been in a while
This is the closest that it's come to the Marshall Mathers
I can hear him start to gather
I don't paint the portrait of the picture perfect Partridge family
This ain't your orphan Annie, no this is more uncanny
Kick down Dakota Fanning's front door while the whore is tanning
("He can't say whore"), of course he can, man he just saw her fanny
Then murdered her while he danced around the room and wore her panties

There's no need to say shit, you already know
The question is just how far will this go?
How far will he take it?
And when will he stop?
Shady man, I done told you once homie to ease up
But you just won't listen will ya? Nah, I guess not
You just can't can ya? Man, I can't stand ya

Ask about me, man, they be like, "There go the candy man"
I park the car in the garage and go in and
Come back the next mornin', the rims are still spinnin'

Custom-fitted, custom-kitted wood grain
Custom everything, what's that on the seat? Custom mustard stain

"Tracy, I joined this class 'cause I thought I'd be cooking with a partner
But she's never here, and I don't get twice the credit for all the work."

"I didn't invent odd numbers, Seth."

"I know, but I'm over here in my unit, every day, cooking my terrible-tasting food, and then I gotta look over at Evan. I mean, look at him, it looks like the most fun I've ever seen in my entire life. And, I'm just saying, I wash and dry, I'm like a single mother. And no offense but, everyone takes this class to get an A and it's bullshit, but uh, no offense, I'm just saying. And I'm not putting down your profession, but when am I gonna need to cook tiramisu? Am I gonna be a chef? No. There's 3 weeks left in school, give me a freaking break, sorry for cursing. Oh my God, that's like the coolest fucking story I've ever heard in my life! It's insane. Can you tell us again? Do you have time? Tracy, Tracy, can you hear me? I'm in the car right now. Listen, I am McLovin, yeah. McLovin in the house! McLovin in the house! Yeah!"

Fame, fame, fame
I think it's got me goin' crazy
Oh, oh
I get lost in this game, game, game
I'm gettin' tired of all you naysayers
Oh, oh
Keep speaking my name, name, name
You gon' have reason to hate me
Yeah
It's like you don't want me to win
So this time I'm goin' in!

This the life of a rocker
Jägermeister and vodka
Hoppin' off of the club's balcony
Into the crowd, surfin'
And when they drop me, I'm randomly sockin' fans
And when my interviews in hockey masks
Slap the journalists on their ass
I'm high off speed
Drivin' my car at high speed
Pocket full of weed, while lesbians swallow E
I'm in the studio ignant
My engineer gon' call police
I fell asleep on the soundboard and get us songs for weeks
LSD be all up in my head
Giving thanks to Grateful Dead
Bustin' in the air, with 30 bitches up in my bed
I'm kickin' 'em out naked, and this December
Niggas ask me why I did it, but fuck it I can't remember

Fame, fame, fame
I think it's got me goin' crazy
Oh, oh
I get lost in this game, game, game
I'm gettin' tired of all you naysayers
Oh, oh
Keep speaking my name, name, name
You gon' have reason to hate me
Yeah
It's like you don't want me to win
So this time I'm goin' in!

Some boys are wiling
Drinkin', cussin', and hyper smilin'
Been ridin' for days, tour bus look like ryker's island
Henny Jack Daniels, spray paintin' the die hard fan
Little cocker spaniel, fresh out of the damn zoo
Man you, better be conscious, I'm backstage
Livin' it up, with a couple of sluts feelin' nauseous
From drinkin' it's been a couple of days, since I've slept
My dick is sore from fuckin', when I bust there's nothin' left
Just dust, back on the stage, give me my microphone
Scrappin' with the audience while we perform hyper song
Our label presented us with a plaque
Brought it on stage, and bashed it to pieces with an aluminum bats, stanks
Now which one of you bitches down for the cause
Yeah I said my dick is sore but I ain't say shit about my balls
Last call then we off to the next city, yeah
Whatever I didn't drink on my bladder pack it up and take the rest with me

Fame, fame, fame
I think it's got me goin' crazy
Oh, oh
I get lost in this game, game, game
I'm gettin' tired of all you naysayers
Oh, oh

You gon' have reason to hate me
Yeah
It's like you don't want me to win
So this time I'm goin' in!

Yeah this game has got me goin' crazy
Fuck it, I am crazy
What's new, what kinda fuckin' glue you'd think I'd be if I was glue
We lost Proof, he was our crew's glue
But where was you, when we were fallin' apart
You were shitting on us too
But no one but us knew we were beefin'
Cause that's what happens when you beef with crew
It stays in the crew, cause it's just crew
But we're back now, yeah we took our time while our blood grew
Only thing we're in a hurry for now is to rush you!
And we're back, these days if you don't got the guts or the nuts to
Pussy, go pick your pussy leaves off your cunt tree, fuck you
Ah choo!
Bless you! I'm allergic to pussy, sluts too
Yeah, you think you the shit, till we flush you
Have some bullshit to readjust
Still got a just a few of us left, but it'd be unjust to rob us our just due
So rest in peace to Bugz and Proof
This one's for you homies, we love you
But we can't stop now we done had too much of our blood drew from this

Fame, fame, fame
I think it's got me goin' crazy
Oh, oh
I get lost in this game, game, game
I'm gettin' tired of all you naysayers
Oh, oh
Keep speaking my name, name, name
You gon' have reason to hate me

So this time I'm goin' in!

Banana, strawberry, pineapple, orange
Put it on my wee-wee
Banana, strawberry, pineapple, orange
Put it on my wee-wee
Banana, strawberry, pineapple, orange
Put it on my wee-wee
Banana, strawberry, pineapple, orange

Got a dick as big as a banana
I try to control it, but I guess I can't, it
Shoots off like an AK-clip banana
You better watch out, Hannah Montana
Man, what's the matter, have you no manners?
No you know the girl from Juno's address
Yeah, I'ma probably go to jail for that
Now I got the cops on my tail for that
Run up on your car with a stale banana
In your tail pipe, can't believe you fell for that
It could've been a Molotov cocktail for that
Wait a minute, man, what the hell was that?
I heard a noise, where you going? What are you, bananas?
You can't go back there, stupid ass
I just seen a woman in a Freddy Kruger mask
Who the fuck are you? Superman?
All you have is a little stupid can
Of whipped cream, what the hell you gonna do with that?
I'ma put it on my wee-wee, ooh, good answer
Super bonanza extravaganza
Man, go ahead, what you waiting for?
You better get them clothes off, baby boy
Come on, let's go, we're gonna make a porn
Ready, set, go hit play, record

Put it on my wee-wee

Are you ready? You better hold the camera steady
She's probably back there with a damn machete
She's probably gonna eat you like canned spaghetti
She's probably gonna kill you, still wanna check, see
Have a little quick look, go on, sick prick
She's probably six foot tall like Big Foot
The hell with that, we probably should run
Don't dare look back, we probably, probably
Probably there probably was a problem
At the post office or something
But you probably didn't know that, did you?
Now, what you gonna do when she gets you?
I ain't going with you, forget you
Quit tryna hold my hand, mister
Pretend she's your little sister, little sister
[?]
Might as well take the whipped cream with you
And when you see her, make sure you get a picture
We could try to make another Blair Witch, uh, movie
A bestiality porno with smoothies

Put it on my wee-wee
Banana, strawberry, pineapple, orange
Put it on my wee-wee
Banana, strawberry, pineapple, orange
Put it on my wee-wee
Banana, strawberry, pineapple, orange
Put it on my wee-wee

It's eerie, but here comes Zack and Miri
Beauty and the Beast, his back is hairy
But she don't care, they're attractive, very
Very sexually active, very
No, Zack, don't go back in there
It's too late now, she's grabbin' hair
He screams, bloody Mary, grabs a mirror
But 'stop' just ain't in her vocabulary
Get off me, please, get off me, stop
Balling back at a coffee shop
They go non-stop, she says go
He says no, she says oh
Back and forth, they scream and shout
Yeah, boy, let them demons out
It's the kind of nightmare you dream about
Uh-oh, now the whipped cream is out
I get sick thoughts, sick, sick, thoughts
Things you could do with your lipstick gloss
Put it on my dick 'til the tip looks orange
Bitch, keep goin', bitch, keep goin'

And I'm willing to borrow your grass
But I specialize in eating MCs
In the immortal words of LL Cool J
As he would say: I'm a G.O.A.T.
And for those of y'all who don't know what a G.O.A.T. is
It means the "greatest of all time"
And I consider myself one of those
So thank you very much, here it goes!

This is the part I was worried about
Everyone thinks that my career is down the tubes
And I'm in some dusty garage inhaling them carbon monoxide fumes
And everyone's telling me what I should do
And how I should come out and what to rap about
And I know that I got a lot up in my medulla oblongata that I gotta get out
And I'm not sure how this is gonna come off
They're probably gonna think that I'm coming off as cocky (ha ha)
Like I just started giving a fuck what you really think about me
See, the thing about me
Is you don't really know a thing about me
Everyone's making a stink about me
Like there's some kind of a aura of that of the king around me
Surround me with nothin' but gangsters, killers, and bangers
And the most dangerous criminals
And I feel like I'm more comfortable around them than I do my own motherfuckin' neighbors
But, see, my dream is to be remembered as one of the best when I leave
But why does it seem like I'm not even put up in the same category as other MCs?
So when Weezy says that he's better than Jay-Z
Please, be that just subliminally
Means he thinks Jigga's the best and that he's
The only one up in that league, see
And it's easy just to consider me one of the greatest white rappers there is
Knowing goddamn well that I'm one of the best motherfucking rappers who ever lived period

I'm a G.O.A.T.
And I don't mean to gloat
But I know what I know and I know what you think
And these magazines'll never put it in ink
Because how would it look if they considered me as a G.O.A.T.?
And for those of y'all who don't know what a G.O.A.T. is
It means the "greatest of all time"
And I consider myself one of those
So thank you very much, here it goes!

Maybe they figure that I'm on my way out the game
So they gotta go try to find em a new Eminem
Or a new Shady, if they think it's gonna happen
Man, I thought I was crazy
Or maybe I could be takin' it wrong and they're tryna pay homage to me in a strange way
So let me pay homage to my fellow white competitors almost in the same way
See, you hardly ever do hear anyone even bringing up that Paul Wall's white
'Cause lyrically he doesn't pose a threat to anyone, see, he's just aight
And Bubba Sparxxx, he just won't write
Because he's so caught up in that snow white
That Timbaland can't even get him in the studio
He's so gone off that coke, right
And it's so sad, 'cause he's dope, right
America's next great white hope, right
So now they feel like they gotta come up with some corny-ass white-rapper show, right
And which I'm still havin' mixed feelings about
They said it'd be real, I'm just spillin' it out
There's somethin' about a white boy talking black and runnin' around with a damn grill in his mouth
And I love when the say that Tiger Woods shit
"Isn't it ironic that the best rapper's white and the best golfer's black?"
And I'm the one who's gotta catch all the flack off of that
But these are the people who never had heard of an Eminem until 8 Mile had came out
But I had already hit middle America
Parents had all got to likin' me now
When suddenly I wasn't such a bad guy
All of the hatred for me must've died
Thought I committed career suicide so I had to turn back into the bad guy
So faggoty faggoty faggoty gays
Anatomy God made Raggedy Ann and Andy
Not Raggedy Andy and Andy and Andy
And Angelina Jolie is just another ho
And Brad is a sucka' because once I fuck her
She wants to go to Somalia to adopt another baby
You know what I say? No
You better save some of them kids from Madonna
She needs all the publicity she can get
You wanted Shady? Well, you got it, man
I ain't apologizin' for shit

I'm a G.O.A.T.
And I don't mean to gloat
But I know what I know and I know what you think
And these magazines'll never put it in ink
Because how would it look if they considered me as a G.O.A.T.?
And for those of y'all who don't know what a G.O.A.T. is
It means the "greatest of all time"
And I consider myself one of those
So thank you very much, here it goes!

Man, I'm takin' my ball and goin' home, man
Shit is too easy
Nobody even wants to pass me the ball 'cause
(I'm a G.O.A.T.)
So don't worry, I'm out the motherfuckin' game
And y'all can sit and argue about who's the motherfuckin' best
But y'all know that
(I'm a G.O.A.T.)
And like I said, I'm one of the motherfuckin' best
Before you get your panties in a motherfuckin' bunch
But before I go, I'd like to say fuck you very much to everybody who wasn't there from the start
And thank you very much to everybody who was
And y'all ain't gotta say it, just think it
'Cause I know that you know that I know that you know that I know that you know
(I'm a G.O.A.T.)
(Hahahaha)
I'm out, y'all
It's been real, peace

I'm a little nutty and I know it but if you go back and take a look at my history
You will see that I am not the only one who's off his rocker, there were many before me
I was always labeled the black sheep of the family, what a bad seed I'd grow to be
But if you take a look at us now you'll see the apple didn't fall too far from the tree

Haha! Haha, haha, haha!
Alright look
I'mma tell you the story from my side
Maybe you'll understand, check it out

You done witnessed unexplainable shit
Too insane to explain, people run from what they just don't get
Maybe Shady should have just hit 'em with a little bit
Did I spit too soon? Should I have spoon fed 'em it?
But I was just so eager to prove I was even
Worth bein' in the same league or the room
Of the people of whom I was in
Every now and then, I look up like I was seekin' approval
Was it because of the pigment of my skin?
Or was it a figment of my imagination?
Maybe it bothered me more than it did them
Maybe it wasn't a big deal back then
But to me it was, see what it was
Was I had developed a complex from being judged
Proof spit his verse, now I'm next, let's see who balks
I'm in the booth staring back to see whose mugs
I get a reaction from, usually the first thumb
Was from Proof and the rest of the crew backed him up
And no one lied to each other 'cause none of us had deals
It was real, we just wanted tickets for that meal

Sometimes I feel like it's just me
Sometimes I feel like I'm goin' crazy
But take a look at my family
'Cause the apple don't fall too far from the tree
I said sometimes I feel like it's just me
Sometimes I feel like I'm goin' crazy
But take a look at my family
'Cause the apple don't fall too far from the tree

Ever since my mother was pregnant with a second egg
'Cause she said that I had a baby sister
Who fell out of the window, I was too young to remember
Kansas City projects, I was like five/six
And how come, I remember Malcolm, Isaac, and Boogy
If it was the projects in Missouri?
'Cause those were my best friends until Isaac
Took my tricycle and my Uncle Todd went to try to go get it back
And ended up gettin' jumped and cut in the gut
With a switch and seventy-some stitches
Which is, to this day, why my mother still tries to show me some old fake picture
Of a fictitious little sister who never existed
And this is why a part of my life's so twisted
But I can never be as sick as that bitch is
And by the way, that picture's one of my relatives

Sometimes I feel like it's just me
Sometimes I feel like I'm goin' crazy
But take a look at my family
'Cause the apple don't fall too far from the tree
I said sometimes I feel like it's just me
Sometimes I feel like I'm goin' crazy
But take a look at my family
'Cause the apple don't fall too far from the tree

You probably have to peel back layers upon layers of pain
To see why everything I say is so insane
What's different about my brain
That separates me from other players in this game?
On the surface, it may seem like a scheme
Or some sort of scam for me to get some damn sympathy
But that's the last thing I need
Is for people to walk around feelin' sorry for me
And I am not a G, never claimed to be
I gave my vest to Cashis, just hope he don't need it more than me
But we'll see, 'cause we ain't lookin' for beef
But if it comes our way, what do we turn the other cheek? Come on

Sometimes I feel like it's just me
Sometimes I feel like I'm goin' crazy
But take a look at my family
'Cause the apple don't fall too far from the tree
I said sometimes I feel like it's just me
Sometimes I feel like I'm goin' crazy
But take a look at my family
'Cause the apple don't fall too far from the tree

Yeah, and I'm the crazy one right?
Whatever, then let me be the crazy one!
Balalalalalalalalalala
Cuckoo, cuckoo, tweet

Thanks, it's been real
I love you but I just can't deal
With the stress this game is giving me
But before I go
You know
I can't close the show
Without no closure
So before I leave

Yeah
I just want to take the time out to basically say
Rest In Peace to Deshaun Holton
That's my heart man
Dr. Dre
For giving me the opportunity
Just to even listen to me
To get me to this point
I wanna thank Jimmy Iovine
Interscope, Aftermath
Everybody in the whole Shady staff
Everybody who's basically supported me from day one
Paul Rosenberg, Tracy McNew
You know I love you guys
I couldn't do it all without you
D12
Ca$his, you're gonna be a beast when you get out there man
Trust me homie, my ears don't lie to me
Who else am I forgetting
Oh yeah, Obie Trice
Bobby Creekwater, and basically man
The whole city of Detroit
8 Mile Road for making what I am today
Which basically goes back to Proof and D12
I love you guys man
Runyon Ave for holding me down when shit got thick
Oh, it wouldn't be complete, if I didn't
Thank my mom, bitch
Haha
So

Thanks it's been real
I love you but I just can't deal
With the stress this game is giving me
But before I go
You know
I can't close the show
Without no closure
So before I leave

Some people ask me where I've been lately
They thought I fell off, nobody could save me
They play in the background, I don't back down
So don't get it twisted and try to play me
First I come out, they underrate me
Then I come back, they still try to fade me
They say I'm nasty, say I'm crazy
They ask what me I think and I say maybe
I'll fly away (Fly away)
It ain't nothing in the way so I may as well
Fly away (Fly away)
And ain't nothing else to say so I may as well
Fly away (Fly away)
I know you wanna see me down but we ain't gon'
Die today (Die today)
'Cause I done been to the top and there's nowhere else to go
(Yeah, yeah) Yeah
And the only way to see me's if you looking up from down below
(Down below, yeah, yeah) Yeah
There's nothing else to say so I may as well
Fly away (Oh)
Yeah, there's nothing in my way so I may as well
Fly away
I'm on top of this thing so I may as well fly away
Yeah

Got my self-esteem back, got my confidence up
I'ma step up on this stage now, I'm gonna strut
And walk around with my pants hangin' off of my butt
And you ain't 'bout to tell me nothing, boy, get off of my nuts
It goes one for the money, two for the show
My shit don't stink, I don't think so
Wipe my ass with the tissue and roll it back up in the roll
Are you ready now, here we go, the bald eagle has landed
I'm back in your hair, sorry for leavin' you stranded
I'm twice as dreaded, evil and rancid
They can't sit, I don't think anybody understands it
Especially when the world's silly putty in your hands, it's Play-Doh
I ain't back to play, though, they say he died in a fatal
Car crash, shows what they know
Shit if I did, it'd be a trailer not a car
The white trash star, I fuck an RV-up like Brett Favre
Homie, you got it backwards, you're dipping your soup inside your crackers
I can carry rap till my back hurts
Set it down, go right back to the chiropractors
Get my back right then I'm right back on you bastards
I was chasing the dragon, I don't know what happened
It's like the feeling I had when I first started rappin', I just
Couldn't seem to get back and recapture that magic, so I went back
To the lab, that's where I've been at, when

Some people ask me where I've been lately
They thought I fell off, nobody could save me
They play in the background, I don't back down
So don't get it twisted and try to play me
First I come out, they underrate me
Then I come back, they still try to fade me
They say I'm nasty, say I'm crazy
They ask what me I think and I say maybe
I'll fly away (Fly away)
It ain't nothing in the way so I may as well
Fly away (Fly away)
And ain't nothing else to say so I may as well
Fly away

I took a hiatus, haters, now I'm back to cause trouble
Got the fuckin' shape of mushroom clouds for thought bubbles, I'm the
[*Explosion*] you ain't fucking sick, the hospital
Won't even give you cough drops for coughs, cocksucker
You think you hot? You ain't even lukewarm my puke's hotter than you
You're soft, I use fire to cool me off
I told 'em I'd grow up one day and show 'em I'd be able to choke clouds
Pick up lightning bolts and throw 'em
Take the world by storm with these words I form
Georgi-porgi kissed the girls, make the girls cry for it
Make 'em swarm, make 'em fight over the shirts I've worn
Swoon over my sweat towels, it's mind blowin'
Yes, I'm livin' the dream, homie, can't nothing compare
I'm so up, I'm stuck in midair, I'm lovin' it, yeah
It's like these people are steps now, all they do is stare
These haters are so pussy, they afraid to be scared
This is pay back, like I owe 'em back pay
They spat in my face, now I'm back to do them the same exact way
And leave this rap game with a bad taste
And slap it back out before I step back outta this crap, they
Slap me, now I'm slappin' 'em back, hey
Fuck it, we're slap happy, yeah, okay, now I'm talking some smack, ayy
And I ain't looking back, in fact, they can stare at my ass crack
How's that for hind sight? What the track say?

Some people ask me where I've been lately
They thought I fell off, nobody could save me
They play in the background, I don't back down
So don't get it twisted and try to play me
First I come out, they underrate me
Then I come back, they still try to fade me
They say I'm nasty, say I'm crazy
They ask what me I think and I say maybe
I'll fly away (Fly away)
It ain't nothing in the way so I may as well
Fly away (Fly away)
And ain't nothing else to say so I may as well
Fly away (Fly away)
I know you wanna see me down but we ain't gon'
Die today (Die today)
'Cause I done been to the top and there's nowhere else to go
(Yeah, yeah) Yeah
And the only way to see me's if you looking up from down below
(Down below, yeah, yeah) Yeah
There's nothing else to say so I may as well
Fly away (Oh)
Yeah, there's nothing in my way so I may as well
Fly away
I'm on top of this thing so I may as well fly away
Yeah

It's like I'm in this dirt, digging up old hurt
Tried everything to get my mind off you, it won't work
All it takes is one song on the radio you're right back on it
Reminding me all over again how you fucking just brushed me off
And left me so burnt, spent a lot of time tryna soul search
Maybe I needed to grow up a little first
Well, looks like I hit a growth spurt
But I'm coming for closure
Don't suppose an explanation I'm owed for
The way that you turned your back on me
Just when I may have needed you most
Oh, you thought it was over
You could just close the chapter
And go about your life, like it was nothing
You ruined mine, but you seem to be doing fine
Well, I've never recovered but tonight I bet you that what you're
'Bout to go through's tougher than anything I ever have suffered
Can't think of a better way to define poetic justice
Can I hold grudges, mind saying, "Let it go, fuck this."
Heart's saying, "I will once I bury this bitch alive
Hide the shovel and then drive off in the sunset."

I flee the scene like it was my last ride
You see right through
Oh, you had me pegged the first time
You can see the truth
But it's easier to justify
What's bad is good
And I hate to be the bad guy
I just hate to be the bad guy
(Follow me, I ruh-uh-un; follow me, I ruh-uh-un)
I just hate to be the bad guy
(Follow me, I ruh-uh-un; follow me, I ruh-uh-un)

And to think I used to think you was the shit, bitch
To think it was you at one time I worshiped, shit
Think you can hurt people and just keep getting away with it?
Not this time, you better go and get the sewing kit, bitch
Finish this stitch so you can reap what you sew, knit wit
Thought some time would pass and I'd forget it? Forget it!
You left our family in shambles
You expect me to just get over him? Pretend he never existed?
May be gone, but he's not forgotten
And don't think 'cause he's been out the picture so long
That I've stopped the plottin' and still ain't coming to get ya
You're wrong and that shit was rotten
And the way you played him's same shit you did to me, cold
Have you any idea the shit that I've gone through?
Feelings I harbor, all this pent-up resentment I hold on to
Not once you call to ask me how I'm doing
Letters, you don't respond to 'em
Fuck it, I'm coming to see you
And gee who better to talk to than you?
The cause of my problems
My life is garbage and I'm 'bout to take it out on you
Poof, then I'm gone, voosh
And

I flee the scene like it was my last ride
You see right through
Oh, you had me pegged the first time
You can see the truth
But it's easier to justify
What's bad is good
And I hate to be the bad guy
I just hate to be the bad guy
(Follow me, I ruh-uh-un; follow me, I ruh-uh-un)
I just hate to be the bad guy
(Follow me, I ruh-uh-un; follow me, I ruh-uh-un)

I've been driving around your side of this town
Like 9 frickin' hours and 45 minutes now
Finally I found your new address, park in your drive
Feel like I've been waiting on this moment all of my life
And it's now arrived, and my mouth is full of saliva
My knife is out and I'm ducking on the side of your house
See, it's sad it came to this point
Such a disappointment I had to make this appointment to come and see ya
But I ain't here for your empathy, I don't need your apology
Or your friendship or sympathy, it's revenge that I seek
So I sneak vengefully and treat your bedroom window
Like I reach my full potential–I peeked
Continue to peep, still bent low
Then keep tapping the glass lightly then start to crescendo
Sneak all the way 'round to the back porch
Man, door handles unlocked, shouldn't be that easy to do this
You don't plan for intruders beforehand?
Surprised to see me? Cat got your tongue?
Gag, chloroform rag, dag almost hack-up a lung
Like you picked an axe up and swung
Stick to the core plan, dragged to the back of a trunk
By one of your fans, irony's spectacular, huh?
Now who's a faggot, you punk?
And here's your Bronco hat, you can have that shit back 'cause they suck
It's just me, you and the music now, Slim
I hope you hear it we're in a car right now
Wait, here comes my favorite lyric
I'm the bad guy who makes fun of people that die
And hey, here's a sequel to my Mathers LP
Just to try to get people to buy
How's this for publicity stunt? This should be fun
Last album now 'cause after this you'll be officially done
Eminem killed by M and M
Matthew Mitchell, bitch, I even have your initials
I initially was gonna bury you next to my brother, but fuck it
Since you're in love with your city so much
I figured, what the fuck the best place you could be buried alive is right here
Two more exits, time is quite near
Hope we don't get stopped, no license I fear
That sirens I hear? Guess 90 on the freeway wasn't the brightest idea
As cops appear in my driver's side mirror
(Oh God, police! Ah!)
Hope Foxtrot gets an aerial shot of your burial plot at least
New plan Stan
Slim, "Chauvinist pig drove in this big, Lincoln Town Car!"
Well gotta go, almost at the bridge, haha big bro it's for you
Slim, this is for him and Frank Ocean, oh, hope you can swim good!
Now say you hate homos again!

I also represent anyone on the receiving end of those jokes you offend
I'm the nightmare you fell asleep and then woke up still in
I'm your karma closing in with each stroke of a pen
Perfect time to have some remorse to show for your sin
Nope, it's hopeless, I'm the denial that you're hopelessly in
When they say all of this is approaching its end
But you refuse to believe that it's over, here we go all over again
Back's to the wall, I'm stacking up all them odds, toilet's clogged
Yeah 'cause I'm talking a lot of shit but I'm backing it all up
But in my head there's a voice in the back and it hollers
After the track is demolished
"I am your lack of a conscience"
I'm the ringing in your ears
I'm the polyps on the back of your tonsils
Eating your vocal cords after your concerts
I'm your time that's almost up that you haven't acknowledged
Grab for some water but I'm that pill that's too jagged to swallow
I'm the bullies you hate that you became
With every faggot you slaughtered
Coming back on you every woman you insult, batter
But the double-standards you have when it comes to your daughters
I represent everything you take for granted
'Cause Marshall Mathers the rapper's persona's half a façade and
Matthew and Stan just symbolic of you not knowing what you had 'til it's gone
'Cause after all the glitz and the glam no more fans that are calling your name
Cameras are off, sad but it happens to all of them
I'm the hindsight to say, "I told you so!"
Foreshadows of all the things that are to follow
I'm the future that's here to show you what happens tomorrow
If you don't stop after they call you
Biggest laughing stock of rap who can't call it quits
When it's time to walk away
I'm every guilt trip the baggage you have
But as you gather up all your possessions
If there's anything you have left to say
'less it makes an impact then don't bother
So 'fore you rest your case
Better make sure you're packing a wallop
So one last time, I'm back
Before it fades into black and it's all over
Behold the final chapter in a saga
Tryna recapture that lightning trapped in a bottle
Twice, the magic that started it all
Tragic portrait of an artist tortured
Trapped in his own drawings
Tap into thoughts
Blacker and darker than anything imaginable
Here goes a wild stab in the dark
Uh, as we pick up where the last Mathers' left off

(What's your name?) Marshall
(Who's your daddy?) I don't have one
My mother reproduced like the Komodo Dragon
And had me on the back of a motorcycle
Then crashed in the side of locomotive with rap, I'm loco
It's like handing a psycho a loaded handgun
Michelangelo with a paint gun in a tantrum
About to explode all over the canvas
Back with the Yoda of rap in a spasm
(Your music usually has them)
(But waned for the game your enthusiasm it hasn't)
(Follow you must, Rick Rubin my little Padawan)
A Jedi in training, colossal brain and, thoughts are entertaining
But docile and impossible to explain and, I'm also vain and
Probably find a way to complain about a Picasso painting
Puke Skywalker, but sound like Chewbacca when I talk
Full of such blind rage I need a seeing eye dog
Can't even find the page, I was writing this rhyme on (oh..)
Oh, it's on a rampage, couldn't see what I wrote I write small
(It says) Ever since I drove a '79 Lincoln with white walls
Had a fire in my heart, and a dire desire to aspire, to die hard
So as long as I'm on the clock punching this time card
Hip-hop ain't dying on my watch

But sometimes, when I'm sleeping, she comes to me in my dreams
Is she taken? Is she mine? Don't got, I don't care, don't have two shits to give
Let me take you by the hand, to promised land, and threaten everyone
'Cause there's no rhyme or no reason for nothing

Nah, (What's your name?) Marshall
(Who's your daddy?) I don't know him, but I wonder
(Is he rich like me?) Ha ha
(Has he taken any time to show you what you need to live?)
No

If he had, he wouldn't have ended up in these rhymes on my pad
I wouldn't be so mad, my attitude wouldn't be so bad, yeah, dad
I'm the epitome and the prime example of what happens
When the power of the rhyme falls into the wrong hands, and
Makes you want to get up and start dancing
Even if it is Charles Manson who just happens, to be rapping
Blue lights flashing, laughing all the way to the bank
Lamping in my K-Mart mansion, I'm in the style department
With a pile in my cart, ripping the aisle apart
With great power comes absolutely no responsibility, for content
Completely, despondent, and condescending
The king of nonsense and controversy is on a
Beat-killing spree, Your Honor, I must plead
Guilty, 'cause I sparked a revolution
Rebel without a cause, who caused the evolution of rap
To take it to the next level, boost it
But several rebuked it, and whoever produced it
(Hip-hop is the devil's music) Does it mean it belongs to me?
'Cause I just happen to be a white honky devil with two horns
That don't honk but every time I speak you, hear a beep?
But lyrically I never hear a peep, not even a whisper
Rappers better stay clear of me, bitch
'Cause it's the…

It's the time of the season, when hate runs high
And this time I won't give it to you easy
When I take back what's mine, with pleasured hands
And torture everyone, that is my plan, my job here isn't done
'Cause there's no rhyme or no reason for nothing

(What's your name?) Shady
(Who's your daddy?) I don't give a fuck, but I wonder
(Is he rich like me?) Doubt it, ha
(Has he taken any time to show you what you need to live?)

So yeah dad let's walk
Let's have us a father-and-son talk
But I bet we wouldn't probably get one block
Without me knocking your block off
This is all your fault
Maybe that's why I'm so bananas
I appeal to all those walks of life
Whoever had strife
Maybe that's what dad and son talks are like
'Cause I related to the struggles of Young America
When their fucking parents were unaware of their troubles
Now they're ripping out their fucking hair again
It's hysterical, I chuckle
'Cause everybody bloodies their bare knuckles
Yeah, uh oh, better beware knuckle heads
The sign on my hustle says "Don't knock"
The door's broken, it won't lock
It might just fly open, get cold-cocked
You critics come to pay me a visit
Misery loves company, please stay a minute
Kryptonite to a hypocrite
Zip your lip if you dish it but can't take it
Too busy getting stoned in your glass house
To kick rocks, then you wonder why I lash out
Mister Mathers as advertised on the flyers
So spread the word 'cause I'm promoting my passion 'til I'm passed out
Completely brain-dead Rainman
Doing a Bankhead in a restraint chair
So bitch, shoot me a look it better be a blank stare
Or get shanked in the pancreas, I'm angrier than
All 8 of the reindeer put together with Chief Keef
'Cause I hate every fucking thing, yeah
Even this rhyme bitch, and quit tryna look
For a fucking reason for it that ain't there
I still am a criminal
Ten-year-old degenerate grabbing on my genitals
The last Mathers LP done went diamond
This time I'm predicting that this one will go emerald
When will the madness end, how can it when
There's no method to the pad and pen
The only message that I have to send
Is "Dad, I'm back at it again."
Bitch (who's your daddy?)

You fucking groupie, pick up the goddamn phone

Bitch, where the fuck were you Tuesday? With who you say?
I wasn't at the studio, bitch, what'd you do? Screw Dre?
You went there looking for me? Boo that excuse is too lame
Keep playin' me, you gon' end up with a huge goose egg
You fake lyin' slut you never told me you knew Drake
And Lupe? you wanna lose two legs?
You tryin' to flip this on me? If I spent more time with you, you say
OK, yeah and I'm coo-coo, ay?
Well screw you and I'll be the third person who screwed you today
Oh, fourth Dre, Drake, Lupe oohm touché
Well you're too two-faced for me thought you was my number one true blue ace
But you ain't
And I can't see you when you make that wittle boo-boo face
'Cause I'm hangin' up this phone, boo you make my fuckin' Bluetooth ache
You're feelin' blue, too late
Go smurf yourself you make me wanna smurf and puke blue Kool Aid
Here's what you say to someone you hate

My life would be so much better, if you just dropped dead
I was layin' in bed last night thinkin' and this thought just popped in my head
And I thought, wouldn't shit just be a lot easier if you dropped dead? I would feel so much much better

Think I just relapsed, this bitch pushed me over the brink
Hop on the freeway, tryna get some time alone and just think
'Til the cops pulled me over but they let me go 'cause I told 'em I'm only drivin' drunk 'cause that bitch drove me to drink
I'm back on my fuck hoes, with a whole new hatred for blondes
But bias? I hate all bitches the same, baby come on
Excuse the pun but bitch is such a 'broad' statement and I'm
Channelin' my anger through every single station that's on
'Cause a woman broke my he-art I say he-art
'Cause she ripped it in two pa-arts and threw it in the garbage
Who do you think you a-are bitch?
Guess it's time for me to get the dust off and pick myself up off the carpet
But I'll never say the L-word again
I lo-lo-lo-lo lesbian
Aaahhh I hope you hear this song and go into a cardiac arrest
My life'd be so much better if you just

My life would be so much better, if you just dropped dead
I was layin' in bed last night thinkin' and this thought just popped in my head
And I thought, wouldn't shit just be a lot easier if you dropped dead? I would feel so much much better

'Cause you told me you'd love me forever bitch that was a lie
Now I never wanted someone to die so bad in my fuckin' life
But fuck it there's other fish in the sea

And I'm a have a whale of a time being a single sailor
For the night, bitch on a scale of
One to ten shit I must be the Holy Grail of
Catches hoe I got an Oscar attached to my fuckin' name (dayla)
I might hit the club find a chick that's tailor
Made for me say fuck it kick some shots back get hammered and nail her
These bitches tryna get attached but they're failin' to latch onto the tail of
My bumper they're scratchin' at the back of my trailer
Like I'm itchin' to get hitched, yeah I'm rich as a bitch
But bitches ain't shit I'd rather leave a bitch in a ditch
Bitch you complain when you listen to this
But you still throw yourself at me that's what I call pitchin' a bitch
That's why I'm swingin' at these chicks on-site
Long as I got a bat and two balls it's 'foul' but my dick's on 'strike'
So all that love shit is null and void, bitch I'm a droid
I avoid Cupid stupid. Wasn't for blow jobs you'd be unemployed
Oye, yoy-yoy
Man oh, man your boy-boy-boy's
Gettin' sick of these girls-girls-girls, oink oink oink
You fuckin' pigs all you're good for is doink doink doink
I got 99 problems and a bitch ain't one
She's all 99 of 'em, I need a machine gun
I'll take 'em all out, I hope you hear this song and go into a cardiac arrest
Have a heart attack and just
Drop dead and I'm a throw a fuckin' party after this
'Cause, yes

My life would be so much better, if you just dropped dead
(I hate you)
I was layin' in bed last night thinkin' and this thought just popped in my head
(You made me like this way)
And I thought, wouldn't shit just be a lot easier if you dropped dead?
(Bitch)
I would feel so much much better

I'm just playin' bitch, you know I love you

Yeah

This is survival of the fittest
This is do or die
This is the winner takes it all
So take it all

Wasn't ready to be no millionaire, I was ill-prepared
I was prepared to be ill though, the skill was there
From the beginning, it wasn't 'bout the ends
It was 'bout busting raps and standing for something, fucking acronym
Cut the fucking act like you're happy, I'm fucking back again
With another anthem, why stop when it doesn't have to end?
It ain't over 'til I say it's over – enough when I say enough
Throw me to them wolves and close the gate up
I'm afraid of what'll happen to them wolves
When the thought of being thrown into an alligator pit, I salivate at it
Wait is up, hands up like it's 12 noon, nah, homie
Hold them bitches straighter up, wave 'em 'til you dislocate a rotator cuff
Came up rough, came to ruffle feathers, nah, egos
I ain't deflate enough, last chance to make this whole stadium erupt 'cause

This is survival of the fittest
This is do or die
This is the winner takes it all
So take it all

I can see the finish line with each line that I finish
I'm so close to my goals I can almost pole vault over the goal post
And if I don't got enough in the tank, maybe I can just siphon enough
To fill up this last can, man will I survive in this climate or what?
They said I was washed up, and got a blood bath
I'm not a rapper, I'm an adapter, I can adjust
Plus I can just walk up to a mic and just bust
So floor's open if you'd like to discuss
Top 5 in this motherfucker and if I don't make the cut
What, like I give a fuck, I'm 'a light this bitch up like I'm driving a truck
To the side of a pump, 0 to 60 hop in and gun it
Like G-Unit without the hyphen, I'm hyping 'em up
And if there should ever come a time where my life's in a rut
And I look like I might just give up, eh might've mistook
Me for bowing out I ain't taking a bow, I'm stabbing myself
With a fucking knife in the gut, while I'm wiping my butt!
'Cause I just shitted on the mic, and I like getting cut
I get excited at the sight of my blood, you're in a fight with a nut
'Cause I'mma fight 'til I die or win
Biting the dust it'll just make me angrier, wait
Let me remind you of what got me this far, picture me quitting
Now draw a circle around it and put a line through it, slut
It's survival of what?

This is survival of the fittest
This is do or die
This is the winner takes it all
So take it all
So take it all

So get your ideas, stack your ammo
But don't come unless you come to battle
Now mount up, jump in the saddle
This is it, it's what you eat, sleep, piss and shit
Live, breathe, your whole existence just consists of this
Refuse to quit, fuse is lit, can't diffuse the wick
I don't do this music shit, I lose my shit
Ain't got shit to lose, it's the moment of truth
It's all I know how to do, as soon as I get thrown in a booth, I spit
But my respect is overdue, I'm showing you the flow no one do
'Cause I don't own no diploma for school, I quit!
So there's nothing for me to fall back on, I know no other trade
So you better trade your fucking mics in for some tool-box-es
'Cause you'll never take my pride from me
It'll have to be pried from me, so pull out your pliers and your screwdrivers!
But I want you to doubt me, I don't want you to believe
'Cause this is something that I must use to succeed
And if you don't like me then fuck you!
Self-esteem must be fucking shooting through-the-roof 'cause trust me
My skin is too thick and bulletproof to touch me
I can see why the fuck I disgust you
I must be allergic to failure 'cause every time I come close to it
I just sneeze, but I just go achoo then achieve!

This is survival of the fittest
This is do or die
This is the winner takes it all
So take it all
So take it all

Tell me where to go, tell me what to do
I'll be right there for you
Tell me what to say, no matter if it's true
I'll say it all for you

I used to be the type of kid that would always think the sky is falling
Why am I so differently wired? Am I a martian?
What kind of twisted experiment am I involved in?
'Cause I don't belong in this world
That's why I'm scoffing at authority, defiant often
Flying off at the handle at my mom, no dad
So I am non-compliant at home, at school I'm just shy and awkward
And I don't need no goddamn psychologist
Tryna diagnose why I have all these underlying problems
Thinking he can try and solve them
I'm outside chalking up drawings on the sidewalk
And in the front drive talking to myself
Either that or inside hiding off in the corner somewhere quiet
Trying not to be noticed 'cause I'm crying and sobbing
I had a bad day at school so I ain't talking
Some cocksucker shoved me into a fucking locker
'Cause he said that I eyeballed him

And if you fall, I'll get you there
I'll be your savior from all the wars that are fought
Inside your world
Please have faith in my words

'Cause this is my legacy, legacy, eh
This is my legacy, legacy, eh
There's no guarantee
It's not up to me
We can only see
This is my legacy, legacy
Legacy, legacy

I used to be the type of kid that would always think the sky is falling
Why am I so differently wired in my noggin?
'Cause sporadic as my thoughts come, it's mind boggling
'Cause I obsess on everything in my mind small shit
Bothers me but not my father, he said Sayonara then split
But I don't give a shit I'm fine long as
There's batteries in my Walkman nothing's the matter with me
Shit look on the bright side at least I ain't walking
I bike ride through the neighborhood of my apartment
Complex on a ten speed which I've acquired parts that I
Find in the garbage, a frame, then put tires on it
Headphones on look straight ahead if kids try and start shit
But if this is all there is for me life offers
Why bother even try and put up a fight, it's nonsense
But I think a light bulb just lit up in my conscience
What about them rhymes I've been jottin'
They're kinda giving me confidence
Instead of tryna escape through my comics
Why don't I just blast a little something like Onyx
To put me in the mood to wanna fight and write songs that
Say what I wanna say to the kid that said that I eyeballed him
Grab hold of my balls like that's right fight's on bitch
Who would've knew from the moment I turned the mic on that
I could be iconic in my conquest
That's word to Phife Dawg from a tribe called Quest

This is my legacy, legacy, eh
This is my legacy, legacy, eh
There's no guarantee
It's not up to me
We can only see
This is my legacy, legacy
Legacy, legacy

I used to be the type of kid that would always think the sky is falling
Now I think the fact that I'm differently wired's awesome
'Cause if I wasn't I wouldn't be able to work
Words like this and connect lines like crosswords
And use my enemy's words as strength
To try and draw from, and get inspired off em
'Cause all my life I was told and taught I am not shit
By you wack fucking giant sacks of lying dog shit
Now you shut up bitch, I am talking
Thought I was full of horseshit and now
You fucking worship the ground on which I am walking
Me against the world so what? I'm Brian Dawkins
Versus the whole 0 and 16 Lions offense
So bring on the Giants Falcons and Miami Dolphins
It's the body bag game bitch I'm supplying coffins
'Cause you dicks, butt kiss, a bunch of Brian Baldingers
You gon' die a ball licker I've been diabolical
With this dialogue since 99 Rawkus
You don't respect the legacy I leave behind y'all can
Suck a dick, the day you beat me pigs'll fly out my ass
In a flying saucer full of Italian sausage
The most high exalting and I ain't halting
'Til I die of exhaustion inhale my exhaust fumes
The best part about me is I am not you
I'm me and I'm the Fire Marshall and this is my

Legacy, legacy, eh
This is my legacy, legacy, eh
There's no guarantee, it's not up to me, we can only see
This is my legacy, legacy
Legacy, legacy

Came to the world at a time when it was in need of a villain
An asshole, that role think I succeeded fulfillin'
But don't think I ever stopped to think that I was speaking to children
Everything was happenin' so fast. It was like I blinked, sold 3 million
Then it all went blank, all I remember is feelin' ridiculous 'cause I was getting sick of this feelin'
Like I'm always under attack, man, I coulda stacked my shit list to the ceilin'
Women dishin' but really
Thinkin' if anyone ever talks to one of my little girls like this I would kill him
Guess I'm a little bit of a hypocrite when I'm rippin' shit. But since when did this many
People ever give a shit what I had to say? It's just my opinion
If it contradicts how I'm livin' put a dick in your rear-end
That's why every time you mention a lyric
I thanked you for it, for drawin' more attention toward it
'Cause it gave me an enormous platform, I'm flattered you thought I was that important
But you can't ignore the fact that I fought for the respect and battled for it
Mad awards, had GLAAD annoyed atta-boy
They told me to slow down, I'd just zone-out
Good luck tryin' to convince a blonde, it's like telling Gwen Stefani she sold out
'Cause I was tryna leave no doubt
In anyone's mind one day I'd go down in history think they know now
Because everybody knows

Everybody knows, that you're just an asshole
Everywhere that you go, people want to go home, everyone knows
Everybody knows, so don't pretend to be nice
There's no place you can hide, you are just an asshole
Everyone knows, everyone knows

Thanks for the support, asshole
Thanks for the support, asshole

Quit actin' salty, I was countin' on you to count me out
Ask Asher Roth when he round about dissed me to shout me out
Thought I was history, well goddamn honky that compliment's like back-handin' a donkey, good way to get your ass socked in the mouth
Nah, I'm off him, but what the fuck's all this trash-talking about?
The fight was fixed, I'm back and you can't stop me you knocked me down
I went down for the count, I fell but the fans caught me and now
You're gonna have to beat the fuckin' pants off me to take my belt
Word to Pacquiao, mama said there ain't nothing else to talk about
Better go in that ring and knock 'em out, or you better not come out
It's poetry in motion like Freddie Roach when he's quotin'
Shakespeare, so what if insults are revoltin'
Even Helen Keller knows life stinks
You think it's a joke 'til you're bullet-riddled, but you should give little shit what I think
This whole world is a mess
Gotta have a goddamn vest
On your chest
And a Glock just to go watch Batman
Who needs to test a testicles? Not that man
Half you don't got the guts, intestinal blockage, rest of you got lap bands
Stuck to this motto 'fore they put bath salts in all those
Water bottles in Colorado, so get lost, Waldo my soul's escaping through this asshole that is gaping
A black hole and I'm swallowin' this track whole, better pack toilet paper
But I'm takin' no crap hoe, here I go down the Bat Pole and I'm changing back into that ole maniac in fact there they go, tryna dip out the back door retreating
'Cause everybody knows

Everybody knows, that you're just an asshole
Everywhere that you go, people want to go home, everyone knows
Everybody knows, so don't pretend to be nice
There's no place you can hide, you are just an asshole
Everyone knows, everyone knows

Holy mackerel. I'm the biggest jerk on the planet Earth. I smacked a girl
Off the mechanical bull at a tractor pull
For thinkin' we had some magnetic pull
Then screamed "ICP in this bitch! How do fuckin' magnets work?"
'Cause you're attractive but we ain't attractable
Hate to be dramatical but I'm not romantical
I'm makin' up words, so you can understandable
It's tragical, thinkin' some magical shit's gonna happen, that ain't practical
You crackin' a joke? It's laughable
'Cause me and love's like a bad combination I keep them feelings locked in a vault, so it's safe to say I'm uncrackable
My heart is truly guarded
Full body armor bitch, you just need a helmet 'cause if you think you're special, you're retarded
Thinkin' you're one of a kind like you got some platinum vagina
You're a trainwreck, I got a one-track mind and, shorty, you're fine but you sorta remind me of a 49er
'Cause you've been a gold digger since you was a minor
Been tryna hunt me down like a dog 'cause you're on my ass but you can't get a cent
'Cause all of my spare time's spent
On my nose in this binder, so don't bother tryin'
Only women that I love are my daughters, but sometimes I rhyme
And it sounds like I forget I'm a father and I push it farther, so, Father, forgive me if I forget to draw the line
It's apparent I shouldn't have been a parent I'll never grow up, so to Hell with your parents and 'mother' fuck 'father' time
It ain't never gonna stop, a pessimist who transformed to an optimist in his prime
So even if I'm half-dead, I'm half-alive
Poured my half-empty glass in a cup now my cup has runneth over
And I'm about to set it on you like a motherfucking coaster
I'm goin' back to what got me here, yeah cocky and
Can't knock bein' Rudolph, so fear not my deer
And dry up your tear drops I'm here
White America's mirror, so don't feel awkward or weird
If you stare at me and see yourself, 'cause you're one too, shouldn't be a shock be
'Cause everybody knows

Everybody knows, that you're just an asshole
Everywhere that you go, people want to go home, everyone knows
Everybody knows, so don't pretend to be nice
There's no place you can hide, you are just an asshole
Everyone knows, everyone knows

Now this shit's about to kick off, this party looks wack
Let's take it back to straight hip-hop and start it from scratch
I'm 'bout to bloody this track up, everybody get back
That's why my pen needs a pad cause my rhymes on the ra-ag
Just like I did with addiction I'm 'bout to kick it
Like a magician, critics I turn to crickets
Got 'em still on the fence whether to picket
But quick to get impaled when I tell 'em stick it
So sick I'm looking pale, wait, that's my pigment
'Bout to go ham, ya bitch, shout out to Kendrick
Let's bring it back to that vintage Slim, bitch
The art of MCing mixed with da Vinci and MC Ren
And I don't mean Stimpy's friend, bitch
Been public enemy since you thought PE was gym, bitch

Kick your shoes off, let your hair down
(And go berzerk) all night long
Grow your beard out, just weird out
(And go berzerk) all night long

We're gonna rock this house until we knock it down
So turn the volume loud, cause it's mayhem 'til the A.M.
So baby make just like K-Fed and let yourself go, let yourself go
Say "Fuck it!" before we kick the bucket
Life's too short to not go for broke
So everybody, everybody (go berzerk), shake your body

Guess it's just the way that I'm dressed, ain't it?
Khaki's pressed, Nike shoes crispy and fresh laced, so I guess it ain't
That aftershave or cologne that made 'em just faint
Plus I showed up with a coat fresher than wet paint
So if love is a chess game, check mate
But, girl, your body's banging, jump me in, dang, bang-bang
Yes siree, 'Bob', I was thinking the same thang
So come get on this Kid's rock, Baw with da baw, dang-dang
Pow-pow, chica, pow, chica, wow-wow
Got your gal blowing up a valve, valve-valve
Ain't slowing it down, throw in the towel, towel-towel
Dumb it down, I don't know how, huh-huh, how-how
Least I know that I don't know
Question is are you bozos smart enough to feel stupid
Hope so, now hoe

Kick your shoes off, let your hair down
(And go berzerk) all night long
Grow your beard out, just weird out
(And go berzerk) all night long

We're gonna rock this house until we knock it down
So turn the volume loud, cause it's mayhem 'til the A.M.
So crank the bass up like crazy and let yourself go, let yourself go
Say "Fuck it!" before we kick the bucket
Life's too short to not go for broke
So everybody, everybody (go berzerk) shake your body

And they say that love is powerful as cough syrup in Styrofoam
All I know is I fell asleep and woke up in that Monte Carlo
With the ugly Kardashian
Lamar, oh sorry yo, we done both set the bar low
Far as hard drugs are though, that's the past
But I done did enough Codeine to knock future into tomorrow
And, girl, I ain't got no money to borrow
But I am trying to find a way to get you alone (car note)
Oh, Marshall Mathers
Shit head with a potty mouth, get the bar of soap lathered
Kangols and car-heart-less cargos
Girl, you're fixing to get your heart broke
Don't be absurd, ma'am, you birdbrain baby
I ain't called anybody baby since Birdman, unless you're a swallow
Word, Rick, word, man, you heard, but don't get discouraged, girl
This is your jam, unless you got toe jam

Kick your shoes off, let your hair down
(And go berzerk) all night long
Grow your beard out, just weird out
(And go berzerk) all night long

We're gonna rock this house until we knock it down
So turn the volume loud, cause it's mayhem 'til the A.M.
So baby make just like K-Fed and let yourself go, let yourself go
Say "Fuck it!" before we kick the bucket
Life's too short to not go for broke
So everybody, everybody (go berzerk), shake your body

We're gonna rock this house until we knock it down
So turn the volume loud, cause it's mayhem 'til the A.M.
So crank the bass up like crazy and let yourself go, let yourself go
Say "Fuck it!" before we kick the bucket
Life's too short to not go for broke
So everybody, everybody (go berzerk) shake your body

Look, I was gonna go easy on you not to hurt your feelings
But I'm only going to get this one chance
(Six minutes, six minutes)
Something's wrong, I can feel it
(Six minutes, six minutes, Slim Shady, you're on)
Just a feeling I've got
Like something's about to happen
But I don't know what
If that means, what I think it means, we're in trouble
Big trouble. And if he is as bananas as you say
I'm not taking any chances
You are just what the doc ordered

I'm beginning to feel like a Rap God, Rap God
All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod
Now who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box, slap box?
They said I rap like a robot, so call me rap-bot

But for me to rap like a computer must be in my genes
I got a laptop in my back pocket
My pen'll go off when I half-cock it
Got a fat knot from that rap profit
Made a living and a killing off it
Ever since Bill Clinton was still in office
With Monica Lewinsky feeling on his nutsack
I'm an MC still as honest
But as rude and as indecent as all hell
Syllables, skill-a-holic (Kill 'em all with)
This flippity, dippity-hippity hip-hop
You don't really wanna get into a pissing match
With this rappity brat
Packing a MAC in the back of the Ac
Backpack rap, crap, yap-yap, yackety-yack
And at the exact same time
I attempt these lyrical acrobat stunts while I'm practicing that
I'll still be able to break a motherfuckin' table
Over the back of a couple of faggots and crack it in half
Only realized it was ironic
I was signed to Aftermath after the fact
How could I not blow? All I do is drop "F" bombs
Feel my wrath of attack
Rappers are having a rough time period
Here's a maxi pad
It's actually disastrously bad
For the wack while I'm masterfully constructing this masterpiece yeah

'Cause I'm beginning to feel like a Rap God, Rap God
All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod
Now who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box, slap box?
Let me show you maintaining this shit ain't that hard, that hard

Everybody want the key and the secret to rap
Immortality like I have got
Well, to be truthful the blueprint's
Simply rage and youthful exuberance
Everybody loves to root for a nuisance
Hit the Earth like an asteroid
Did nothing but shoot for the moon since (pew)
MCs get taken to school with this music
'Cause I use it as a vehicle to 'bust a rhyme'
Now I lead a new school full of students
Me? I'm a product of Rakim
Lakim Shabazz, 2Pac, N.W.A., Cube, hey, Doc, Ren
Yella, Eazy, thank you, they got Slim
Inspired enough to one day grow up
Blow up and be in a position
To meet Run-D.M.C. and induct them
Into the motherfuckin' Rock n'
Roll Hall of Fame even though I walk in the church
And burst in a ball of flames
Only Hall of Fame I'll be inducted in is the alcohol of fame
On the wall of shame
You fags think it's all a game
'Til I walk a flock of flames
Off a plank and
Tell me what in the fuck are you thinking?
Little gay-looking boy
So gay I can barely say it with a 'straight' face, looking boy
You're witnessing a mass-occur like you're watching a church gathering take place, looking boy
Oy vey, that boy's gay
That's all they say, looking boy
You get a thumbs up, pat on the back
And a "way to go" from your label every day, looking boy
Hey, looking boy, what d'you say, looking boy?
I get a "hell yeah" from Dre, looking boy
I'mma work for everything I have
Never asked nobody for shit
Get outta my face, looking boy
Basically boy you're never gonna be capable
Of keeping up with the same pace, looking boy, 'cause

I'm beginning to feel like a Rap God, Rap God
All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod
The way I'm racing around the track, call me NASCAR, NASCAR
Dale Earnhardt of the trailer park, the White Trash God
Kneel before General Zod this planet's Krypton, no Asgard, Asgard

So you'll be Thor and I'll be Odin
You're rodent, I'm omnipotent
Let off then I'm reloading
Immediately with these bombs I'm totin'
And I should not be woken
I'm the walking dead
But I'm just a talking head, a zombie floating
But I got your mom deep-throating
I'm out my Ramen Noodle
We have nothing in common, poodle
I'm a Doberman, pinch yourself
In the arm and pay homage, pupil
It's me
My honesty's brutal
But it's honestly futile if I don't utilize
What I do though for good
At least once in a while so I wanna make sure
Somewhere in this chicken scratch I scribble and doodle
Enough rhymes to
Maybe try to help get some people through tough times
But I gotta keep a few punchlines
Just in case 'cause even you unsigned
Rappers are hungry looking at me like it's lunchtime
I know there was a time where once I
Was king of the underground
But I still rap like I'm on my Pharoahe Monch grind
So I crunch rhymes
But sometimes when you combine
Appeal with the skin color of mine
You get too big and here they come trying to
Censor you like that one line I said
On "I'm Back" from The Mathers LP
One when I tried to say I'll take seven kids from Columbine
Put 'em all in a line
Add an AK-47, a revolver and a nine
See if I get away with it now
That I ain't as big as I was, but I'm
Morphin' into an immortal coming through the portal
You're stuck in a time warp from two thousand four though
And I don't know what the fuck that you rhyme for
You're pointless as Rapunzel
With fucking cornrows
You write normal? Fuck being normal
And I just bought a new ray gun from the future
Just to come and shoot ya
Like when Fabolous made Ray J mad
'Cause Fab said he looked like a fag
At Mayweather's pad singin' to a man
While he played piano
Man, oh man, that was a 24/7 special
On the cable channel
So Ray J went straight to the radio station the very next day
"Hey, Fab, I'mma kill you"
Lyrics coming at you with supersonic speed, (JJ Fad)
Uh, summa lumma dooma lumma you assuming I'm a human
What I gotta do to get it through to you? I'm superhuman
Innovative and I'm made of rubber, so that anything you say is
Ricocheting off of me and it'll glue to you
I'm devastating more than ever demonstrating
How to give a motherfuckin' audience a feeling like it's levitating
Never fading, and I know that haters are forever waiting
For the day that they can say I fell off, they'll be celebrating
'Cause I know the way to get 'em motivated
I make elevating music
You make elevator music
"Oh, he's too mainstream."
Well, that's what they do
When they get jealous, they confuse it
"It's not hip-hop, it's pop."
'Cause I found a hella way to fuse it
With rock, shock rap with Doc
Throw on "Lose Yourself" and make 'em lose it
"I don't know how to make songs like that
I don't know what words to use."
Let me know when it occurs to you
While I'm ripping any one of these verses that versus you
It's curtains, I'm inadvertently hurtin' you
How many verses I gotta murder to
Prove that if you were half as nice
Your songs you could sacrifice virgins to
Unghh, school flunky, pill junky
But look at the accolades these skills brung me
Full of myself, but still hungry
I bully myself 'cause I make me do what I put my mind to
And I'm a million leagues above you
Ill when I speak in tongues
But it's still tongue-in-cheek, fuck you
I'm drunk. So, Satan, take the fucking wheel
I'm asleep in the front seat
Bumping Heavy D and the Boyz
Still "Chunky, but Funky"
But in my head there's something
I can feel tugging and struggling
Angels fight with devils and
Here's what they want from me
They're asking me to eliminate some of the women hate
But if you take into consideration the bitter hatred I had
Then you may be a little patient and more sympathetic to the situation
And understand the discrimination
But fuck it
Life's handing you lemons
Make lemonade then
But if I can't batter the women
How the fuck am I supposed to bake them a cake then?
Don't mistake him for Satan
It's a fatal mistake if you think I need to be overseas
And take a vacation to trip a broad
And make her fall on her face and
Don't be a retard, be a king?
Think not
Why be a king when you can be a god?

Eminem has a full line of chainsaws
Eminem... Eminem... Eminem... Eminem... Eminem... Eminem
Marshall Mathers, Eminem, the rapper... Eminem
Who can say for sure?
Perhaps a frontal lobotomy would be the answer
If science could operate on this distorted brain and put it to good use
Society would reap a great benefit

I walk around like a space cadet, place your bets
Who's likely to become a serial killer, case of Tourettes
Fuck fuck fuck can't take the stress
I make a mess, as the day progresses, angry and take it out on the neighbors hedges
Like this is how I'll cut your face up, bitches with these hedge trimmin' scissors with razor edges
Imagination's dangerous it's
The only way to escape this mess and make the best of this situation, I guess
'Cause I feel like a little bitch, this predicament's
Despicable I'm sick of just getting pushed it's ridiculous
I look like a freakin' wuss, a pussy this kid just took
My stick of licorice and threw my sticker books in a picker bush
I wanna kick his tush, but I was six and shook
This fucker was twelve and was six foot with a vicious hook
He hit me I fell, I got back up all I did was book, now there's using your head
Mama always said

If you had a brain you'd be dangerous, a brain you'd be dangerous
I'mma prove you wrong
Mama, I'mma grow one day to be famous and I'mma be a pain in the anus
I'mma be the bomb
I'mma use my head as a weapon, find a way to escape this insaneness
Mama always said, "Son, if you had a brain you'd be dangerous, guess it pays to be brainless."

Fast forward some years later a teenager, this is fun, sweet
I just got jumped twice in one week, it's complete
It's usually once a month, this is some feat
I've accomplished they stomped me into the mud, gee for what reason? You stumped me
But how do you get the shit beat outta you, beat down and be upbeat, when you don't have nothing?
No valid shot at life, chance to make it or succeed
'Cause you're doomed from the start, it's like you grew up on Jump Street from jump street
But if I could just get my head out my ass
I could accomplish any task
Practicin' trash-talkin'
In a trance locked in my room, yeah but I got some plans, mama
These damn rhymes are fallin' outta my pants pocket, I can't stop it
And I'm startin' to blend in more
In school this shit helps for sure, I'm gettin' more self-assured than I've ever been before
Plus no one picks on me anymore, I done put a stop to that, threw my first punch end of story
Still in my skull's a vacant empty void been usin' it more as a bin for storage
Take some inventory
In this gourde there's a Ford engine, door hinge, syringe, an orange an extension cord and a ninja sword
Not to mention four linchpins, an astringent stored
Ironin' board a bench, a wrench, a ore, wench an attention whore
Everything but a brain, but dome's off the fuckin' chain like an independent store
Something's wrong with my head
Just think if I had a brain in it, thank God that I don't, 'cause I'd probably be Dahmer, 'cause mama always said

If you had a brain you'd be dangerous, a brain you'd be dangerous
I'mma prove you wrong
Mama, I'mma grow one day to be famous and I'mma be a pain in the anus
I'mma be the bomb
I'mma use my head as a weapon, find a way to escape this insaneness
Mama always said, "Son, if you had a brain you'd be dangerous, guess it pays to be brainless."

Now my mom goes wahm-wahm-wahm
'Cause I'm not that smart, but I'm not dumb
I was on the bottom of the pile gettin' stomped
But somehow I came out on top
(Oh-oh-oo-oh)

I told you one day, I said they'd have that red carpet rolled out, yo
I'm nice ya'll, fuck it, I'm out cold
Now everywhere I go they scream out go, I'm bout to clean house, yo
I'm Lysol, now I'm just household
Out sold the sell-outs, freak the hell out Middle America, hear 'em yell out, in terror they were so scared and those kids
Just about, belted out whatever spouted or fell out my smart aleck mouth it was so weird
Inappropriate? So be it, I don't see it
Maybe one day when the smoke clears it won't be as
Motherfuckin', difficult yeah, 'til then hopefully ya
Little homos get over your fears and phobias
It's OK to be scared-straight they said I provoked queers
'Til emotions evoke tears, my whole career's
A stroke of sheer genius, smoke and mirrors tactical practical jokes, yeah
You motherfuckin' "insert insult here"
Who the fuck woulda thunk that one little ole MC'd
Be able to take the whole culture and re-upholstery it?
And boy, they did flock, can't believe this little hick locked
This hip-hop shit in his hip pocket and still the shit got
That white-trash traffic in gridlock shit hoppin' like six blocks
From a Kid Rock Insane Clown Posse concert in mid October
And God forbid I see the Wizard and get a brain in my titanium cranium, y'all cause
I'll turn into the Unabomber mama always said

If you had a brain you'd be dangerous, a brain you'd be dangerous
I'mma prove you wrong
Mama, I'mma grow one day to be famous and I'mma be a pain in the anus
I'mma be the bomb
I'mma use my head as a weapon, find a way to escape this insaneness
Mama always said, "Son, if you had a brain you'd be dangerous, guess it pays to be brainless."

"Insaneness" ain't even a word you stupid fuck
Neither is "ain't"

You used to say that I'd never be nothing without you
And I believe
I'm shot in the lungs, I gasp, I can't breathe
Just lay here with me, baby, hold me please
And I'd beg and I'd plead, drop to knees
And I'd cry and I'd scream, "Baby, please don't leave!"
Snatch the keys from your hand
I would squeeze and you'd laugh
And you'd tease, you're just fucking with me
And you must hate me
Why do you date me if you say I make you sick?
And you've had enough of me
I smother you, I'm 'bout to jump off the edge

But you won't break me
You'll just make me stronger than I was
Before I met you, I'll bet you I'll be just fine without you
And if I stumble, I won't crumble
I'll get back up and uhhh
And I'mma still be humble when I scream, "Fuck you!"
'Cause I'm stronger than I was

A beautiful face is all that you have
'Cause on the inside you're ugly and mad
But you're all that I love
I grasp, you can't leave
Please stay here with me, baby, hold me please

And I'd beg and I'd plead, drop to knees
And I'd cry and I'd scream, "Baby, please don't leave!"
But you left and you took everything I had left
And left nothing, nothing for me
So please don't wake me from this dream, baby
We're still together in my head
And you're still in love with me
'Til I woke up to discover that that dream was dead

But you won't break me
You'll just make me stronger than I was
Before I met you, I'll bet you I'll be just fine without you
And if I stumble, I won't crumble
I'll get back up and uhhh
And I'mma still be humble when I scream, "Fuck you!"
'Cause I'm stronger than I was

You walked out, I almost died
It was almost a homicide that you caused 'cause I was so traumatized
Felt like I was in for a long bus ride
I'd rather die than you not by my side
Can't count how many times I vomited, cried
Go to my room, turn the radio on and hide
Thought we were Bonnie and Clyde
No, on the inside you were Jekyll and Hyde I
Felt like my whole relationship with you was a lie
It was you and I, why did I think it was ride or die?
'Cause if you coulda took my life you woulda
It's like you put a knife to my chest and pushed it right through to the
Other side of my back and stuck a spike, too, should've
Put up more of a fight, but I couldn't at the time
No one could hurt me like you could've
Take you back now, what's the likelihood of that?
Bite me, bitch, chew on a nineteen footer
'Cause this morning I finally stood up
Held my chin up, finally showed a sign of life in me for the
First time since you left and left me with nothing but shattered dreams
And the life we could've had and we could've been
But I'm breaking out of this slump I'm in
Pulling myself out of the dumps once again
I'm getting up once and for all, fuck this shit
I'mma be late for the pity party
But you're never gonna beat me to the fucking punch again
Took it on the chin like a champ so don't lump me in with them chump-ions
I'm done being your punching bag

It was November 31st today, would've been our anniversary
Two years, but you left on the first of May
I wrote it on a calendar, was gonna call, but couldn't think of the words to say
But they came to me just now, so I put 'em in a verse to lay
And I thank you (uh) 'cause you made me (uh) a better person than I was
But I hate you (uh) 'cause you drained me (uh)
I gave you all, you gave me none
But if you blame me (uh), you're crazy (uh)
And after all is said and done
I'm still angry, yeah, I may be
I may never trust someone

But you won't break me
You'll just make me stronger than I was
Before I met you, I'll bet you I'll be just fine without you
And if I stumble, I won't crumble
I'll get back up and uhhh
And I'mma still be humble when I scream, "Fuck you!"
'Cause I'm stronger than I was

I wanted the fame, but not the cover of Newsweek
Oh, well, guess beggars can't be choosey
Wanted to receive attention for my music
Wanted to be left alone in public. Excuse me
For wanting my cake and eat it too, and wanting it both ways
Fame made me a balloon 'cause my ego inflated
When I blew; see, but it was confusing
'Cause all I wanted to do is be the Bruce Lee of loose leaf
Abused ink, used it as a tool when I blew steam (wooh!)
Hit the lottery, oh wee
But with what I gave up to get it was bittersweet
It was like winning a used mink
Ironic 'cause I think I'm getting so huge I need a shrink
I'm beginning to lose sleep: one sheep, two sheep
Going cuckoo and cooky as Kool Keith
But I'm actually weirder than you think

Now, I ain't much of a poet but I know somebody once told me
To seize the moment and don't squander it
'Cause you never know when it all could be over tomorrow
So I keep conjuring, sometimes I wonder where these thoughts spawn from
(Yeah, pondering'll do you wonders.
No wonder you're losing your mind the way it wanders.)
Yoda-loda-le-hee-hoo
I think it went wandering off down yonder
And stumbled on 'ta Jeff VanVonderen
'Cause I need an interventionist
To intervene between me and this monster
And save me from myself and all this conflict
'Cause the very thing that I love's killing me and I can't conquer it
My OCD's conking me in the head
Keep knocking, nobody's home, I'm sleepwalking
I'm just relaying what the voice in my head's saying

Call me crazy but I have this vision
One day that I'd walk amongst you a regular civilian
But until then drums get killed and I'm coming straight at
MCs, blood get spilled and I'll
Take you back to the days that I'd get on a Dre track
Give every kid who got played that
Pumped up feeling and shit to say back
To the kids who played him
I ain't here to save the fucking children
But if one kid out of a hundred million
Who are going through a struggle feels it and then relates that's great
It's payback, Russell Wilson falling way back
In the draft, turn nothing into something, still can make that
Straw into gold chump, I will spin Rumpelstiltskin in a haystack
Maybe I need a straightjacket, face facts
I am nuts for real, but I'm okay with that

I own a mansion but live in a house
A king-size bed, but I sleep on the couch
I'm Mister Bright Side, glass is half-full
But my tank's half empty, gasket just blew

This always happens
Thirty minutes from home gotta lay a log cabin, only option I have's McDonald's' bathroom
In a public stall droppin' a football so every time someone walks in the John I get Maddened
"Shady, what up?" What? Come on, man, I'm crappin'
And you're askin' for my goddamn autograph on a napkin?
Oh, that's odd, I just happened
To run out of tissue, yeah, hand me that on second thought I'd be glad then
"Thanks dog. Name's Todd, a big fan" I
Wiped my ass with it, crumbled it up in a wad threw it back and
Told 'im, "Todd, you're the shit." When's all of this crap end?
Can't pump my gas without causin' an accident
Pump my gas, cut my grass, I can't take out the fuckin' trash
Without someone passin' through my sub harassin'
I'd count my blessings but I suck at math
I'd rather wallow than bask, suffering succotash, but the ant-
Acid it gives my stomach gas
When I mix my corn with my fuckin' mashed
Potatoes, so what hoe kiss my country bumpkin ass
Missouri southern roots, what the fuck is upper class?
Call lunch dinner, call dinner supper, Tupperware in the cupboard plastic ware up the ass
Stuck in the past iPod what the fuck is that?
B-Boy to the core, mule, I'm a stubborn ass

Maybe that's why I feel so strange
Got it all, but I still won't change
Maybe that's why I can't leave Detroit
It's the motivation that keeps me going
This is the inspiration I need
I could never turn my back on a city that made me
And "life's been good to me so far"

They call me classless I heard that
I second and third that
Don't know what the fuck I'd be doin' if it weren't rap
Probably be a giant turd sack
But I blew, never turned back
Turned forty and still sag
Teenagers act more fuckin' mature Jack
Fuck you gonna say to me? I'll leave on my own terms ass
Hole I'm going berserk, my nerves are bad
But I love the perks my work has
I get to meet famous people look at her, dag
Her nylons are ran, her skirt's snagged and I heard she drag-races [burp] swag
Tuck in my Hanes shirt tag
You're Danica Patrick (yeah) word skag
We'd be the perfect match, 'cause you're a vacuum, I'm a dirtbag
My apologies
No disrespect to technology
But what the heck's all of these buttons?
You expect me to sit here and learn that?
Fuck I gotta do to hear this new song from Luda
Be an expert at computers?
I'd rather be an Encyclopedia Britannica
Hell with PlayStation, I'm still on my first man on some Zelda
Nintendo, bitch! Run, jump, punch, stab, and I melt the
Mozzarella on my spaghetti put it on bread make a sandwich with Welch's
And belch, they say this spray butter's bad for my health,
But I think this poor white trash from the trailer
Jed Clampett, Fred Sanford and welfare, mentality helps to
Keep me grounded, that's why I never take full advantage of wealth
I managed to dwell
Within these parameters
Still crammin' the shelves full of Hamburger Helper
I can't even help it, this is the hand I was dealt a
Creature of habit, feel like I'm trapped in an animal shelter
With all these pet peeves, God damn it to hell
I can't stand all these kids with their camera cellphones
I can't go anywhere, I get so mad I could yell the
Other day someone got all elaborate
And stuck a head from a fuckin' dead cat in my mailbox
Went to Burger King, they spit on my onion rings
I think my karma's catching up with me

Maybe that's why I feel so strange
Got it all, but I still won't change
Maybe that's why I can't leave Detroit
It's the motivation that keeps me going
This is the inspiration I need
I could never turn my back on a city that made me
And "life's been good to me so far"

Got friends on Facebook all over the world
Not sure what that means, they tell me it's good
So, I'm artist of the decade, I even got a plaque
I'd hang it up but the frame is all cracked

I'm tryin' to be low-key, hopefully nobody notices me
In produce, hunched over, giant nose bleed
Ogre style as I mosey over to the frozen aisle, by the frozen yogurt this guy approached me
Embarrassed, I just did Comerica with Hova the show's over, I'm hidin' in Kroger buyin' groceries
He just had front-row seats told me to sign his poster then insults me
"Wow up close didn't know you had crow's feet!"
I'm at a crossroads, lost, still shopping at Costco's
Sloppy Joe's, bulk waffles
Got caught pickin' my nose (aaghh!) look over see these two hot hoes
Finger still up one of my nostrils
Right next to 'em, stuck at the light the fuckin' shit's
Takin' forever to change, it's stuck these bitches are lovin' it
Rubbin' it in, chucklin'
Couldn't do nothin' play it off "What you bumpin'?"
"Trunk Muzik, Yelawolf's better", fuckin' bitch
They want me to flip at the label, but I won't succumb to it
The pressure, they want me to follow up with a
Nother one after Recovery was so highly coveted
But what good is a fuckin' recovery if I fumble it?
'Cause I'mma drop the ball if I don't get a grip, hoppin' out shrubbery on you sons of bitches
Wrong subdivision
To fuck with, bitch, quit snappin' fuckin' pictures of my kids
I love my city,
But you pushed me to the limit. What a pity
The shit I complain about
It's like there ain't a cloud in the sky, and it's rainin' out
Kool-Aid stain on the couch, I'll never get it out
But, bitch, I got an elevator in my house, ants and a mouse
I'm livin' the dream

Maybe that's why I feel so strange
Got it all, but I still won't change
Maybe that's why I can't leave Detroit
It's the motivation that keeps me going
This is the inspiration I need
I could never turn my back on a city that made me
And "life's been good to me so far"

Something's burnin' I can't figure out what
(Out what) it's either lust, or a cloud of dust, judgment is clouded must
Just be the powder from the power of
(Love) but I'm in somethin' I don't know how to get outta
Left my girl in the house alone, is that my soon-to-be-spouse's moan and the further I walk the louder
Pause for a minute to make certain that's what I heard, 'cause after all this is her place
So I give her the benefit of the doubt I
Think I might be about to busta, bust her, the thought's scary yo, though and it hurts-brace
Hope it ain't "here we go, yo" 'cause my head already goes to worst-case scenario, though in the first place
But you confirmed my low end theory though, should've known when I made it all the way to third base
And that was only the first date, could've made it to home plate
But you slid straight for the dome and dove face
First "No [*slurp*], you don't [*slurp*] under—[*slurp*]—stand [*slurp*]. I [*slurp*] don't [*hic*] do [*slurp*] this for anyone ever."
Yeah, that ain't what they all say
I'll say, you can suck a softball through a straw
Used to be my fiancé, 'til you sucked on Wayne, André and Kanye
LeBron, Akon, Jay, Lil' Jon, Raekwon, Ma$e, Polow Tha Don, Dre
Dante Ross, James Conway, Kwame
Guess I'm gettin' my g-God dang Jigga on, eh?
'Cause your name I'm beyond sayin'
But fuck it I'm movin' on, you women are all cray
But I'll probably always keep on playin'
The game of love, love, love, love, la-la-la-la-la love

She doesn't love me, no she don't love me no more
She hates my company, guess she don't love me no more
I tried to get her up out of my head, left my bags at the door
She screamed she loved me, like she never did before
And I told her: go where you wanna go, go do what 'cha wanna do, I don't care
And I told her: go where you wanna go, go do what 'cha wanna do, I don't care
I told that bitch

I'm a sucker for love, you're a sucker for dick
Suckin' dick in your mama tub, then your granny walked in
Told the stupid nigga to duck under the water he drowned, like an abortion, they booked you for manslaughter
You beat the case and I called ya'
"Sherane is not available now leave a message at the tone
And, Kendrick, don't forget to buy two pair of those
Expensive heels ya little fuckin' Ferris Wheel
Fuckin' spinnin' on me. Fuck ya think? We're gonna get married still?
Fucking Mary had a little lamb this ain't no fairy tale
Fairy God mama better tell you how I fuckin' feel
Like you should fuckin' beat it or fuckin' eat it while I'm on my period
Now have a blessed day..." Bitch, you serious?
I'm in the mirror with this look on my face, curious
Why you ain't fuckin' with me, you cut me deep as a Caesarean
You know I want you bad as a Benjamin, I'm delirious
I want you bad as the head shattered on George Zimmerman
After the Dillinger hit him diligently and killin' 'im
His mouth piece for a Cadillac emblem
That's analogy and metaphor for you
I should win a medal for all the ways I adore you
This is me talkin' cordial, yeah I got some home trainin'
That ain't what you like, ain't it? What about if I was as famous
As Marshall, would you give fellatio in the carpool?
Cops pull us over, they just wanna know if you gargle
Singing, "I hope she's good enough
Meanwhile you're chasing her."
Chlamydia couldn't even get rid of her, pity the fool and pity the fool in me I'mma live with the
Game of love, love, love, love, la-la-la-la-la love

She doesn't love me, no she don't love me no more
She hates my company, guess she don't love me no more
I tried to get her up out of my head, left my bags at the door
She screamed she loved me, like she never did before
And I told her: go where you wanna go, go do what 'cha wanna do, I don't care
And I told her: go where you wanna go, go do what 'cha wanna do, I don't care
I told that bitch

So needless to say, I'm feelin' betrayed, snatch my house key off her key chain
She jumps off 'Wee-Bey' from the Wire's dick now she's chasin' me with a cheese grater
Here goes that broken record cliché, it's all my fault anyway she's turnin' the tables, I'm a beat-break
She treats my face like Serato, she cuts and scratches like a DJ, each day is an Instant Replay
They say what we display, is symptomatic of addict behavior
Back together, but forgot today was her B-Day
She cut me off on the freeway
Simple misunderstandin' but just as I went to slam on the brakes, that's when I realized that she may be crazy as me, wait
Bitch cut my fuckin' brake line, stepped on them fuckers eight times, still goin' 73 thank
God there's an exit comin' up, what the mother F-U-C-K's
Wrong with her, hit the off-ramp, 'til I coasted to a goshdamn halt, hit a fucking tree now here she comes at full speed she's racing at me, OK, you wanna fuck with me 'eh?
Snatch that bitch out her car through the window she's screamin' I body slam her on the cement until the concrete gave
And created a sink hole, buried the stink hoe in it, then paid to have the street repaved (the fuck?)
Woke up in a dream state
In a cold sweat like I got hit with a freeze ray, durin' a heat wave
Guess I eventually caved though, 'cause she's layin' next to me in bed
Directly aimin' a gat at my head
Woke up again and jumped up like fuck it, I've had it I'm checkin' into rehab
I confess I'm a static addict I guess
That's why I'm so clingy every girl I've ever had either says
I got too much baggage or I'm too fuckin' dramatic, man what the fuck is the matter? I'm just
A fuckin' romantic, I fuckin' love you, you fuckin' bitch! Combative, possessive, in fact last time I was mad at an ex
I actually set off a chain reaction of tragic events
I said, "Hit the road," and after she left I sent that bitch a text
I said, "Be careful driving. Don't read this and have an accident!" She glanced to look at it and wrecked
Too bad, thought we had a connect no sense dwelling makes
Never been a more compelling case, than the model covered in L'Oréal and Mace
Who fell from grace eleven stories, for story telling, while the whore was yelling rape
'Til her vocal cords were swelling and her voice was more hoarser than Tori Spellings' face
Still they swarm the gates
Of my fancy estates to greet Norman Bates with a warm embrace
'Less you're Andrea Yates, don't ask me for a date
Don't be late, well, the sentiment's great
But wait, think there's been a mistake
You wanted an intimate date, I wanna intimidate
I have infinite hate in my blood
It's mainly 'cause of the game of
[*Phone ring*] wait, "Dinner at eight?"
I have infinite hate in my blood
It's mainly 'cause of the game of love

Love, love, love
La-la-la-la-la love

Mom, I know I let you down
And though you say the days are happy
Why is the power off, and I'm fucked up?
And, Mom, I know he's not around
But don't you place the blame on me
As you pour yourself another drink, yeah

I guess we are who we are
Headlights shining in the dark night I drive on
Maybe we took this too far

I went in headfirst
Never thinking about who what I said hurt, in what verse
My mom probably got it the worst
The brunt of it, but as stubborn as we are
Did I take it too far?
"Cleaning Out My Closet" and all them other songs
But regardless I don't hate you 'cause, Ma
You're still beautiful to me, 'cause you're my mom
Though far be it from you to be calm, our house was Vietnam
Desert Storm and both of us put together can form an atomic bomb equivalent to chemical warfare
And forever we can drag this on and on
But, agree to disagree
That gift from me up under the Christmas tree don't mean shit to me
You're kicking me out? It's 15 degrees and it's Christmas Eve (little prick just leave)
Ma, let me grab my fucking coat, anything to have each other's goats
Why we always at each other's throats?
Especially when dad, he fucked us both
We're in the same fucking boat, you'd think that it'd make us close (nope)
Further away it drove us, but together headlights shine, a car full of belongings
Still got a ways to go, back to grandma's house it's straight up the road
And I was the man of the house, the oldest, so my shoulders carried the weight of the load
Then Nate got taken away by the state at eight years old
And that's when I realized you were sick and it wasn't fixable or changeable
And to this day we remain estranged and I hate it though, but

I guess we are who we are
Headlights shining in the dark night I drive on
Maybe we took this too far

'Cause to this day we remain estranged and I hate it though
'Cause you ain't even get to witness your grand babies grow
But I'm sorry, Mama, for "Cleaning Out My Closet", at the time I was angry
Rightfully maybe so, never meant that far to take it though
'Cause now I know it's not your fault, and I'm not making jokes
That song I no longer play at shows and I cringe every time it's on the radio
And I think of Nathan being placed in a home
And all the medicine you fed us
And how I just wanted you to taste your own
But now the medication's taken over
And your mental state's deteriorating slow
And I'm way too old to cry, the shit is painful though
But, Ma, I forgive you, so does Nathan, yo
All you did, all you said, you did your best to raise us both
Foster care, that cross you bear, few may be as heavy as yours
But I love you, Debbie Mathers, oh, what a tangled web we have
'Cause one thing I never asked was
Where the fuck my deadbeat dad was
Fuck it, I guess he had trouble keeping up with every address
But I'd have flipped every mattress, every rock and desert cactus
Owned a collection of maps and followed my kids to the edge of the atlas
Someone ever moved them from me? That you coulda bet your asses
If I had to come down the chimney dressed as Santa, kidnap them
And although one has only met their grandma once
You pulled up in our drive one night as we were leaving to get some hamburgers
Me, her and Nate, we introduced you, hugged you
And as you left I had this overwhelming sadness come over me
As we pulled off to go our separate paths
And I saw your headlights as I looked back
And I'm mad I didn't get the chance to thank you for being my Mom and my Dad
So, Mom, please accept this as a tribute I wrote this on the jet
I guess I had to get this off my chest
I hope I get the chance to lay it before I'm dead
The stewardess said to fasten my seatbelt, I guess we're crashing
So if I'm not dreaming, I hope you get this message that I'll always love you from afar
'Cause you're my Ma

I guess we are who we are
Headlights shining in the dark night I drive on
Maybe we took this too far

I want a new life (start over)
One without a cause (clean slate)
So I'm coming home tonight (yeah)
Well, no matter what the cost
And if the plane goes down
Or if the crew can't wake me up
Well, just know that I'm alright
I was not afraid to die
Oh, even if there's songs to sing
Well, my children will carry me
Just know that I'm alright
I was not afraid to die
Because I put my faith in my little girls
So I never say, "Goodbye, cruel world."
Just know that I'm alright
I am not afraid to die

I guess we are who we are
Headlights shining in the dark night I drive on
Maybe we took this too far

I want a new life

Yeah, trying to figure out the difference
But I think, I think the lines are starting to get blurry

I'm in a strange place
I feel like Ma$e when he gave up the game for his faith
I feel like I'm caged in these chains and restraints
Grimming every stranger in the place while I gaze into space
'Cause I'm mentally rearranging his face
I need a change of pace 'cause the pace I'm working at is dangerous
There's nowhere to dump this anger and thanks to this angst
I done quit chicken heads in cold turkey and started slowly roasting 'em
'Cause that's where most of my anger is based
Fuck your feelings, I feel like I play for the Saints
I just wanna hurt you, aim for the skanks
Then aim for all these fake Kanyes, Jays, Waynes and the Drakes
I'm frustrated 'cause ain't no more N'Sync, now I'm all out of whack
I'm all out of Backstreet Boys to call out and attack
I'm going all out in this rap shit and whatever the fallout is
I'm strapped for battle sucka-duck, crawl out the back, it's a bar fight
Prepare your arsenal and beware of bar stools flying through the air
And bottles breaking, mirrors also
And I ain't stopping 'til the swear jar's full
You done called every woman a slut, but you're forgetting Sarah, Marshall (Palin)
Oh my bad, slut
And next time I show up to court I'll be naked and just wear a lawsuit
Judge be like "That's sharp, how much did that motherfucker cost you?
Smart ass, you're lucky I don't tear it off you
And jump your bones, you sexy motherfucker
You're so fucking gravy, Marshall, I should start calling you "au jus"
'Cause all's you do is spit them lyrics out the wazoo
Evil twin, take this beat now, it's all you."
I believe people can change, but only for the worse
I could've changed the world if it wasn't for this verse
So satanic K-Mart chains panic
'Cause they can't even spin back the curse words
'Cause they're worse when they're reversed, motherfucker
(rape your mother, kill your parents)

Shit, motherfucker, and these kids are like parrots
They run around the house just like terrorists
Screaming "fuck, shit, fuck"
Adult with a childish-like arrogance
Wild ever since the day I came out I was like "merits, fuck that"
I'd rather be loud and I like swearing
From the first album even the gals were like "tight lyrics, dreamy eyes"
But my fucking mouth was nightmarish
And from the start of it you felt like you were a part of this
And the opposition felt the opposite
Sometimes I listen and revisit them old albums
Often as I can and skim through all them bitches
To make sure I keep up with my competition
(ha ha) Hogger of beats, hoarder of rhymes
Borderline genius who's bored of his lines
And that sort of defines where I'm at and the way I feel now
Feel like I might just strike first and ignore the replies

There's darkness closing in (evil twin)
There it goes again (my evil twin)
It controls my pen (my evil twin)
But that ain't me, it's my evil twin
(then I step out and see my evil twin he gives me an evil grin)
But he's just a friend (evil twin)
Who pops up now and again (again)
So don't blame me (evil twin)
Blame him, it's my evil twin
(then I step out and see my evil twin he gives me an evil grin)

Welcome back to the land of the living, my friend
You have slept for quite some time

So who's left? Lady Gaga? Mess with the Bieber?
Nah, F with Christina, I ain't fucking with either Jessica neither
Simpson or Alba, my albums just sicker than strep with the fever
Get the Cloriseptic, Excedrin, Aleve or Extra Strength Tylenol 3's
Feel like I'm burning to death, but I'm freezin'
Bed-ridden and destined never to leave the
Bedroom ever again like the legend of Heath-uh Ledger
My suicide note's, barely legible read the
Bottom, it's signed by The Joker
Lorena said I never can leave her
She'd sever my wiener I ever deceive her
Fuck that shit, bitch
Give up my dick for pussy, I'd be Jerry Mathers
I ever left it to Beaver
Get them titties cut off tryna mess with a cleaver
Golly-wally, I vent, heat register, Jesus
Ever since 1-9-9-4-6 Dresden it was definitely my destiny
When on the steps I met DeShaun at Osborn
I'd never make it to sophomore
I just wanted to skip school and rap, used to mop floors
Flip burgers and wash dishes while I wrote rhymes tryna get props for 'em
'Cause I took book-smarts and swapped for 'em
They were sleeping, I made 'em stop snorin'
Made 'em break out the popcorn
Now I've been hip-hop in its tip-top form
Since N.W.A. was blaring through my car windows leaning on the horn
Screaming, "Fuck the police!" like cop porn
Flipped rap on its ear like I dropped corn
Fuck top 5, bitch, I'm top 4
And that includes Biggie and Pac, whore
And I got an evil twin, so who the fuck do you think that 3rd and that 4th spot's for?
And crazy as I am I'm much tamer than him
And I'm nuts, then again who the fuck wants a plain Eminem?
But no one's insaner than Slim, look at that evil grin (evil twin)
Please come in, what was your name again?
Hi, faggot
Look who's back with a crab up his ass like a lobster crawled up there
Two rabbits, a koala bear and a ball of hair
And you're all aware I don't got it all upstairs
Guess that's why I'm an addict and it's so small up there
Peace to Whitney, geez, just hit me
That I should call the Looney Police to come get me
'Cause I'm so sick of being the truth I wish someone'd finally admit me
To a mental hospital with Britney
Oh, LMFAO, no way, ho
Jose Baez couldn't beat this rap, OJ no
Hooray, I'm off the hook like Casey Anthony
Hey ho, hey ho
I sound like I'm tryna sing the fucking chorus to "Hip Hop Hooray"?
No, I'm hollering, you got bottom end like an 8-0-8
And I base whether we're fucking off that instead of your face, so
Let your low-end raise, yo
Tango, what you think, ho?
Slow dancing in the bowling
You tryna hold hands with your homie?
What? You think I'm looking for romance 'cause I'm lonely?
Change that tune, you ain't got a remote chance to control me
Hoe, I'm only vulnerable when I got a boner
Superman tried to fuck me over, it won't hurt
Don't try to fix me, I'm broke so I don't work
So are you, but you're broke 'cause you don't work
But all bullshit aside I hit a stride
Still Shady inside, hair every bit as dyed
As it used to be when I first introduced y'all to my skittish side
And blamed it on him when they tried to criticize
'Cause we are the same, bitch

I'm liable to start a violent spark with a silent thought
I disgust you like dialogue from The Shop to The Wired Frog
Night club, shit, I was taught
If your CD's on fire you had to put it out yourself like Highland Park
No fire department, so you might not hear sirens at all
But don't be alarmed if I sound off
Something just ain't right with me, dog
A martyr on a private charter, whose life could be harder?
Widely regarded highly? Bite me, sweetheart
I'm slightly retarded, but tonight I'm startin'
Shit, I'm feeling self righteous and might just hop in a mosh pit
On some Mike Tyson and Pac shit
Lookin' to box with anybody, disorderly conduct
I'll fuck around and snort a key and pick a fight with a locksmith
Fan of The LOX, bananas, manic, I'm going in shock
Frantic, I'm trapped in a closet
Panic attack 'cause I'm claustrophobic
No, faggot, I mean I can't maneuver for movement
'Cause I have no room for improvement
I'm practically squashed, compacted and boxed in
Toxic, cans of arsenic, flammable bars, examine the content
Bar exam, start of insanity
Charles Hamilton slash Manson and Bronson
Animal snarls, cannibal jaws
Shark mandibles, lambs to the slaughter
Looking skantless as Hannibal's stalking
Anthony Hopkins with his hands in his pockets
(Whistle) Black out, Zach Galifianakis
Gallons of Vodka, but that gal has some knockers
I bet you they ring a bell when I come back and I'm conscious
What happened, doc? I passed out again
Alcohol's making me break into vacant's naked
Stolen Magnavox and bag of rocks in back of a Datsun
Fell asleep watching Fear Factor and Scare Tactics
Too close to the StairMaster
Poked a hole in the air mattress and popped it
Woke up shortly thereafter, hungover
No underwear, grasping a Bayer Aspirin and dropped it
Air Maxes in my closet, preposterous Nikes made out of ostrich
And the cross stitching is a cross mixing
Of a rhinoceros, possum skin, giraffe and a dolphin
Fin, cotton Dockers, OshKoshes, drop crotches
Swatch watches and sneakers match with the parkas
But it's like being overstaffed at a boxing gym
With all these trainers, but I don't have any boxers
And I'm standing here naked, hangover, still wasted
Like paper you write raps on, obnoxious
Yo, why does it always sound like I'm grabbing my nostrils?
Fuck that, I'll battle 'em all, I'll battle a mall
I'll stand there and yell that at a wall
'Til the mannequin dolls scatter and the inanimate objects
That I'm battering all shatter and fall
'Cause I hear the track and I'm starting to get fucking amped
I'm a spark plug, I'm like the car with the cables
Hooked up to my fucking back, I'm a Duracell
But I sure as hell got it backwards 'cause y'all get jumped
And I'll catch the battery charge, but
I got a hunch like your back when it's arching
When I start attacking your squadron
You'll feel like MasterCard when I'm charging
So take a swipe at me, I'm coming straight at you
Like Clay Matthews from the Green Bay Packers
So get the sack like Wisconsin
That's nutbag that I'm talking, who am I kidding?
You faggots are all gonna do my bidding
Don't get dragged to the auction
Neiman Marcus, bags of Vuitton and all
I'll push a bitch into oncoming traffic, just watch this
Stretched, tinted, black sedan my ass
See how mad you act when I drop you off at Saks Fifth Ave
In a fucking taxi cab to go shopping
Affable guy next door's laughable
My next whore's gonna have mechanical arms
That'll jack me off with a lotion dispenser with a motion sensor
No emotion, hence I guess this sick prick dies hard
I got a Magic Johnson
It's like a Magic Wand allows me to not let a blonde arouse me
If Ronda Rousey was on the couch with the condoms out
Holding a thousand Magnums at once to pounce me
I laugh in response to how she dances and flaunts it around me
Her flat little badonkadonk is bouncing around
And all I see is Paulie Malignaggi, she Slaughterhouse in a blouse
And Madonna with mud on her, God dammit I am a misogynist
I slap Linda Ronstadt with a lobster, throw her off a balcony
Just so happens she's fond of algae
'Cause now she faceplants on the concrete
Complete lack of responsibility
Half of you assholes ain't strong enough to pick up a spirit
Shit, you fags couldn't shoplift at a thrift shop
But I let the track lift 'em up, boost the energy
Klepto, I'm back to rip shop up, but my thing is this now
Five-finger discount
Been rapping so long I've been killing this shit, it's easy
Kidnapping your mom 'cause I'm still in this bitch, thievery
Ransom for JonBenét Ramsey, and Chandra Levy, and Gary Condit
("Em") Paul was scared that if I went back to the blonde
I might relapse, get on some bullshit
Perhaps I'll launch some cracker taunts at Action Bronson
Macklemore, Mac Miller and Asher Roth
And have some back and forths
And record a wack response to Kendrick Lamar's "Control" verse
And perform "Fack" in concert ["Fack" plays]
Yo, I put that shit on a greatest hits album
Now that was awesome
It takes some massive balls to do some shit like that
Sometimes I have to ponder why people are like (I'll stick around)
And put up with my crap so long for, what's the attraction, mama?
Is it the fact that I'm a walking, talking, actual quadruple entendre
Or the pointy nose that's pointing at you, mama?
Who knows at this point, it's always poking so na-ah
Still get along with this voice 'cause that's the "Monster"
So do-si-do with the (na-ah) sociopath
Everyone who knows me knows that
What they don't know is the fact Rihanna calls me Pinocchio
(Na-ah) She loves the way I lie
Sits on my face and waits for my nose to grow
Pathological liar, oh, why am I such an asshole
That my disguise is pants, but they on fire
So am I-a, (Wu) Cappadonna, cut the track off
Sabotage Christmas, crap in your stocking
I'm wrapping up all the presents
In fucking camouflage so you can't even find 'em
Jack Santa Claus, snap Rudolph's antlers off
Wrap his schnoz in gauze bandage and blind him
Blowing a head gasket at Bed, Bath and Beyond
Put the basket back all the bath salt packets are gone, I
Know you really tired of me sampling Billy Squier
But classic rock acid rap is the genre
Got Slash on guitar, splash of Bizarre, Thrasher, and Aerosmith
And I'm a spectacular archer, feed Count Dracula Chocula
Godzilla, half dragon and Bob Dylan, bandwagoners
I'm kicking the damn stragglers off and I'm strangling 'em
Smack Kim Basinger on her ass in the sauna

Just so you don't die alone

I roll over and go to reach for you, you're gone
This bed's empty without you
You said you're moving on
But I'm having some trouble getting there
But dwelling ain't getting me, uhh, anywhere
Fuckin' Valentine's Day
Fuck February, stuffed teddy bear, guts everywhere
Machete on the floor, I smashed up every mirror
Yeah, how do I look?
You fuckin' just left me here to die didn't you?
Why didn't you respond yet?
I've written you five or six different times and
I'm gettin' sick and tired of always apologizing to you
I didn't do shit to deserve what you're puttin' me through
This couldn't be true, we can't be over
So violets are blue, roses are red
Why is it everything I do I'm reminded of you?

Saw two white coffins in my dreams last night
I saw my Lord Jesus with his hands pointed toward the light
Saw my old sweetheart she said, "Honey, I'm back"
Just so you don't die alone, just so you don't die alone

Guess I gotta deal with the fact that, you ain't never comin' back
Now every woman that I look at I'm lookin' for you
So I'm findin' something the matter with them
Excuse to not see anyone
Useless, rather pick up the phone, not at all, followin' protocol
I get bold like bowling balls
Grow balls and go to call to talk, forget what I want to say
Damnit I'm drawin' blanks like I'm playin' hangman
I'm sick of playin' these games, I can't handle this heartbreak
It's makin' me wanna blow out my brains
Like birthday cake candles
Hang up the phone and I shake, I think I may have made a mistake
Can't escape the madness
Turn the radio on, I hate this sad song
But I can't even change the station
The same one's playin' on eight channels
I lay awake in shambles, I'm startin to hallucinate
I'm havin' all these visions of us at each other's wakes
In caskets and suddenly I wake and that's when I know I

Saw two white coffins in my dreams last night
I saw my Lord Jesus with his hands pointed toward the light
Saw my old sweetheart she said, "Honey, I'm back"
Just so you don't die alone, just so you don't die alone

Give me one more, bottle for the pain
Give me one more for the memories
Give me one more, I'll make it taste like a steak
It'll help alleviate
It'll soothe this ache
Of trying to fake
That she's really, she's really coming back

And it's been a while now, but I finally realize how
Much reality sucks, but it's just something about our love
I'm still in denial now, dealing with the finality of it
And it's making me crazy thinking of the days we, spent
And how I'll never hold you again
And there ain't shit I can do about it
Now my head is overcrowded
With these clouded memories and I can't seem to get you out it
And how the fuck do you sleep comfortably
Knowing what you done did to me, huh?
Did it even occur to you that I loved you?
Completely, deep, and madly head over heels for you
Was you and me, once used to be together forever
It was supposed to be us, but you crushed the dream
We was supposed to die together, and it's killing me so much
When I sleep I wake up dead, must be why I

Saw two white coffins in my dreams last night
I saw my Lord Jesus with his hands pointed toward the light
Saw my old sweetheart she said, "Honey, I'm back"
Just so you don't die alone, just so you don't die alone

Got a shitty grin, bitch show me them itty-bitty titties again
We're in Sin City, since when did we begin to get addicted to dope
Diggity, bitch, you need to run and go get your friggidy-friends
I'm looking at your bum-stickidy-bum hun
The migidy mac's, bigidy back
Don't act wigidy-wack, you can get the figidy-finger, the middle
You little dizzy bitch, sit spiggidy spin
Got a 6 o' clock craving, stop get Ciroc
It's about to be an unbelievable night
I call it surreal, Sir Mix a Lot tape in
Hit the spot, spot my next victim up
Picky like I missed a spot shaving
Came to sip vodka, shit yeah, that little chick is hot but if she got rabies
I wouldn't give the bitch a shot, I poke her in the rear
But I bet if I lick her, she'll try to chase me (Haha)
What are you pit, rott, mixed oh, you just got fixed well shit then let's lip-lock
If not then trick piss off you snobby little pig snot nose
You think you're hot shit cause you're in heat
Well, bitch, if you're solar
Then I'm your polar opposite dog cause I'm colder than popsicle sticks, poppin' shit
Talkin' it, walkin' it, spit rocks
Then my sick thoughts are about to lick shots
Like this shit's hopping, and drip-dropping in chocolate-ly whip-topping
So whether you're Hip Hop, Slipknot, Big, Pac
Kid Rock, Kris Kross, Rick Ross, you'll dig this
If not then kick rocks in flip flops
And I produced the track
So you don't have to ask who it is when this shit knocks (TURN UP!)
So bring clairvoyance to this bangin and I'm a keep on saying
All the shit I should be hung for, and probably killed for saying
And I probably will, but not until the day I pop a pill again
Like chopping 'til I'm dropping, still if that don't do the job of killing Shady, then the karma will, insane him
I'm as brainy Mohammad until the Parkinson's done eat away my brain
And made me Robin Williams crazy
Or I end up with dementia, but you rocking with a sadist
So you can say this, but if the thought is entertaining
I ain't stopping to explain it
Oh my God, for real man, not again I'm shaking
But before I tie a rope around this nob
If they don't like it, got a knob they can slob on until it's-
Wait I just forgot what I was thinking...
What's it called again? I'm blanking
Something about the balls between my legs and I think I can feel it dangling, it's throbbing and it's veiny
Wait I think I got it, okay bitch I got you, Robin Williams hanging
Let's Go hang in the lobby unless you came to slob me
Come on kemosabe
It's past time, like your favorite hobby
Cause if the way that I spit shit remains on my dick then she grab me by the nuts and tried to take my sausage as a hostage
Ain't it obvious? Pretty much a no brainer, or should I say Cobainer?
That she's plain addicted to my dick like Lorena Bobbit
Got a wean her off it, weiner off it like she took my fucking penis, chopped it, and stuck it up between her armpits
And she begun to swing a crumpet knife and paint the carpet, at least that's what her train of thought is
Cause I came, saw, conquered, hit it, quit it, and made up a plane of bonkers
And I always end up giving these bitches some complex
And I don't mean apartment
So spread your feet apart
And let me see you do some yoga stretches, splits
Now grab this Cuisinart
And make me breakfast, bitch, that's a prerequisite
And that's just to get in this bedroom, bitch
Walked up to that Ke$ha chick (what up?)
Said my names Booger, wanna catch a flick?
I'll even let you pick, make her fetch a stick
Bet you if you get this old dog these new tricks
To get familiar with I'll learn extra quick
Kick a pregnant bitch, oops, I guess the shit
Took an unexpected twist like the neck of the freaking exorcist
Bitch, I said that this mask ain't for hockey
Hate Versace, Versace, I got Münchhausen by proxy
I'm making you sick, don't pretend you can't hear me
You deaf, girl, I said you was foxy
I'll tell a bitch like Bizarre
Bitch, shut the fuck up and get in my car
And suck my fucking dick while I take a shit
And I think with my dick so come blow my mind
And it tastes like humble pie
So swallow my pride, you're lucky just to follow my ride
If I let you run alongside the Humvee
Unless you're Nicki, grab you by the wrist, let's skeet
So what's it gon' be? Put that shit away Iggy
You gon' blow that rape whistle on me
(Scream!) I love it
'Fore I get lost with the gettin' off
Like this is our exit, now let's hit the highway and try not to get lost
'Till we get to Las Vegas

(Party, do it 'till tomorrow)
Vegas
'Till we get to Las Vegas
(Party, do it 'till tomorrow)
Vegas
'Till we get to Las Vegas
(Party, do it 'till tomorrow)
Vegas
'Till we get to Las Vegas
(Party, do it 'till tomorrow)
Vegas

Whatever happens here, stays here
So let's go all the way dear
Til we get to Las Vegas

These donuts are delicious... son of a bitch!
We got a 10-94 on Hines Road, requesting backup.
Repeat, 10-94 on Hines Road heading southbound. I'm in pursuit!

Pick up, pick up, daddy's in the pickup
Got so much bounce the kick drum give me the hiccups
You don't want it with me, sucker, just look up
Beer flyin' in this mothafucka like bird shit
Ran these Mickey Thompsons up on the curb, bitch
Crook as a picture on Sunday
My maniac Slumerican squad mount up around your Hyundai
Chevy's up, we got low lives and bow ties
Up shit's creek, I'll take you for a boat ride
Stick his head in the water, now let him flap his lips
Motormouth, make a wave, yeah, Roll Tide
You're playin' golf in lightning? So am I
Dressed in a tin man suit
Drinkin' a tin can too, that is 110 proof
Man if I only had a heart for you bitches
I'd get down on my knees and help you dig them ditches
But mama only raised Hell
So when you're done diggin' that ditch, bitch, bury yourself
Pass me that Colt 45
I'm partyin' 'til my fuckin' throat sore and dry

I'm goin' down
Aww man you gotta love it
I'm on my way
Hey mama, all around the town they're sayin'
"He's goin' down, Lord have mercy"
I'm country rich, no budget
Got to get paid
Hey daddy, all around the town they're sayin'
"He's goin' down, Lord have mercy"

You drivin' drunk, better lift your seat up
Cause cops pull us over just to fuckin' meet us
Cause Marshall's a Rap God, damn right
Well, then I guess that makes me Jesus
So turn this water to whiskey
Watch the dirty south go from dirty to filthy
High class only means stoned in school
Joints rolled up bigger than pony stool
Smoke, stains on the roof of the old Regal's brown
So what I got spokes on this bitch, and?
The lift kicks like climbin' into a spaceship
UFO's, unidentified flyin' Oldsmobiles
And mobile homes, amen
I can still smell the kerosene leakin'
I should've seen the signs, I was blowin' up
Either in a trailer home or a pickup
Hey, Bubba, your baby boy is in big trouble
I fuckin' ran through a briar patch and got cut up
Now I'm wide open in front of the whole town
I bled for the game, I guess it's obvious now
I'm goin' down now, he told me wear it with pride
You wanna take the hard road you gotta cherish the ride
Most mothafuckers won't jump to embarrass the fly
Can't build a legacy up, then let it perish and die

Another day, another hotel, the inside of it is nice though, oh well
This is my life so as I go and try on clothes for tonight's show
To see how far that line goes, still blows my mind, show business
Guess I'll just never get, so this shit just always feels so weird
To this day because all's I ever did
Was just say the shit I would've wanted to hear
Other people say to me when I was a kid
So please don't make me some type of hero
'Cause I will say some ol' inspirational shit in a real way
But still will have a field day with some of the fucked up shit
In the world and tell it to suck on the dick, 'cause I still make fun
Of a sitch someone's in like a son of a bitch at another's expense
I'm fuckin' relentless as fuck when it comes to this pen
I struggle with coming to senses, stuck on the fence
It's a balance beam, if I seem unbalanced, it's challenging
When my conscience allows me to think the most foulest
Childish things without even blinking, without even thinkin' about
All the stinkin' amounts of people that seems to be reachin'
But the crowds, they're screaming
And The Palace sold out this evening
But now it's lay me down to sleep
And is it really my soul to keep, or have I sold it cheap?
Is it greed? And do I take more than I need?
When I joke of leavin', but keep overachievin'
'Cause what it's stole from me I've barely broken even

I know, it's a fine, fine line
Living in hope or dire need
I know, it's a fine, fine line
Living in hope or dire need

So a martyr is how I paint myself
And through my harrowin' ordeals I'm so vain I want my respect
But ignore the butterfly effect that comes from my dialect
'Til I sit in the dark and I reflect
And my reflection shows what it's like here
'Cause this vanity, surrounded by all these lights
Yeah, it's like a nightmare
I said, this vanity surrounded by these lights is a night mirror
And I don't like how I see myself, so I open the Bible to Isaiah
'Cause I swear to Christ there are nights when I stay up and might
Say a prayer twice just to make sure God hears
'Cause this ice layer I skate on's a nice way of putting it
But I like stayin' feistier than a triceratops and like a dice player
I got a nice paradise here, sealed off in my lair
Away from the bullshit good safe place to sit and talk shit from
And this house, is quite bare, but it ain't when you can't leave it
And I feel so isolated, it's nice I made it
But it's like I paid the price of fame twice, I hate it
So I bitch about my life then make another song
Vicious cycle ain't it, then wonder why I stay famous
I keep walkin' the line, this goldfish bowl gets old
But especially when you don't know
If your conscience is sayin' I told you so
'Cause you don't even know anymore
If you got the soul of a soldier, or you sold your soul

I know, it's a fine, fine line
Living in hope or dire need
I know, it's a fine, fine line
Living in hope or dire need

And from here you look so small
Hovering high above us all
Please come back to me

I still remember the times when
They were simpler than the rhymes of
Vanilla Ice were when I was just killin' the mics
I'll never forget what that feeling was like
I miss those times now when I was just starting out
Without a dime and now I'm diamond
I can't even stage dive in the crowd anymore now when I've been
Stuck in this house hibernatin', hate even going outside
It sucks, sometimes I just wanna walk into Target and look at shit and browse, I don't even want to buy nothin'
I just wanna fuckin' walk around inside it
Look how excited I sound when I get to talkin' bout life and
Everything about it I miss, which now reminds me
Put a thousand lighters in the sky for the Outsidaz
Wow, I must have had Alzheimer's
Long time since I shouted them out, 'bout time
'Cause it's been on my mind lately how
Zee, you always supported me
You vouched, I will never forget that and
How you guys accepted me for me and Pace
I love you too, you slept on my couch
And I've been thinkin' 'bout the time
When I slept on the floor at The Outhouse
Rhyming's all we ever wanted to do
And regardless how life has turned out
Inside I'll, I'll always be an outsider
My life has been turned inside out but I—

I know, it's a fine, fine line
Living in hope or dire need
I know, it's a fine, fine line
Living in hope or dire need

But I keep walkin' the line

I feel phenomenal as usual
Pharmaceuticals, glue sniffin', pools of vomit at Bonnaroo
But I don't know if I'm in Tennessee, Chicago, or Houston
In the corner tryin' to seek solitude
Shallow but such a hollow dude
I won't even swallow solid food
Alcoholic too, plus I'm on lean like the Tower of Pisa
Top it off I'm on mushrooms, so fuck all of you!
Roses are violet, mollies are blue
Lost in a ball of confusion, it's all an illusion
It's probably the shrooms I'm on
'Cause I think I started hallucinating, 'cause I just thought I heard Jay Electronica and Odd Future's new shit
And all I could do was follow the music
And end up with Paula Abdul at Lollapalooza
Fillin' water balloons with nail-polish remover
Just to pop 'em and wallow in fumes
I feel uptight, I gotta get looser
After I finish polishing off this bottle of booze I got a solution
Concentrated like orange juice, so I'm not as deluded
'Cause all this delusion got me seein' shit
Excusez-moi, but that hoochie that passed
You see her ass? Wouldn't make her my main squeeze
Butt juicier, ass, it belongs in a juicer
It's mouth-waterin' too
So I walked over to her, like, "I'm Marshall
Wanna try to meet my standards? I'll introduce ya"
Oh, I'm a misogynist too, but I'm not a masseuse
But my attitude is rubbin' off on the youth, uh!
Chronic abuser, and I don't mean a user of marijuana
I mean verbal assault that I use to smoke all of you losers
Got a bazooka, a shotgun, a Ruger, a Glock, and a nuke
And a Rottweiler too, and I'm not in the mood, so
When I say I'm bringing the TEC out
I'm not coming to repair your fuckin' electronic computers
God, I'm gonna puke, I'm so gone off the hookah
I think I swallowed a loofah
I'm tore up, demolished, I'm fuckin' stoned like Oliver
Like I looked Medusa in the eyeball to seduce her
The thoughts I produce are loony tunes
The box of reusable latex gloves and the socks and the shoes
That were placed next to Veronica's boobs
And the paycheck stubs that were stuffed in the glove box
In a blue Honda with used condoms were clues
The girl was just not the one suitable for him

Right for me, (that will) change me
Rearrange my head to be
Just right for you and me
Don't laugh, please listen to me

Thought I'd give in to the pressure
Collapse and crumble perhaps, relapsing under that
Well, that's a bunch of crap
In the clutch, I'm the Captain Crunch of rap
And I'm sick of acting humble, that's enough of that
Fuck that shit, cut the sack
Like it's a natural reaction
That's why I'm actually trapped in this shoving match
'Cause push keeps coming to that
I can keep getting my ass kicked and coming back
Like a sarcastic crumpled sack of shit, still mad
Disgruntled, had some struggles, yeah
But that passion and hunger's back
What a fantastic juggling act!
And the way I flip my tongue on the track
It's like verbal acrobatics, but in fact
Last time I tried to pull off a dramatic stunt as drastic
I fuckin' crashed my hovercraft
After I strapped a duffel bag to my back
And stuffed a massive punchin' bag in it
And an elastic bungee strap, rubber, plaster, a thumb tack
And a piece of plastic bubble wrap
Went spastic and fuckin' snapped
Jumped and splashed in a puddle of battery acid
Stumbled back, recovered, back flipped
And landed on a gymnastic tumble mat
And for my last trick, lunge on back
Latch on a NASA shuttle flap, fuckin' snap the rudder in half
Chuckled and laughed, utter my last rebuttal
And just as I'm to come crashin'
I grab my Go-Go-Gadget inflatable gigantic humongous mattress and ceramic construction hat
Rub my magic mushroom tat
For luck, then splat, get up from that
Face taped to a waste paper basket
Throw up, then gasp, lungs collapsed
And that's more likely than finding someone that's…

Right for me, (that will) change me
Rearrange my head to be
Just right for you and me
Don't laugh, please listen to me

Couple of shots of Jäger
Public intoxication, dis-fuckin'-combobulation
Flooded with thoughts of anger
While I was away I know probably some of you got to thinkin'
"You're top ten, ain't you?"
Stop it, you fuckers are talkin' crazy
And stop interrupting, you're not even up in that conversation
Whether you're punchin' a clock or famous
Underground, pop, or nameless
Whatever your job is, I give a fuck what's your occupation
You're thinkin' just 'cause you came in with scrubs
And you brought the scalpel and sponge
The oxygen tank and the suction and shot the brain surgeon
Stuck in the operating room
Once you done swapped your name with him
Smuggled in Ronald Reagan
If you dug him up; Donald Fagen
While juggling waffles, bacon
A fuckin' McDonald's egg and cheese sausage bagel finagled it
Flung it across the table
Then bump it and knock it shake it
Jumped and got in the way, then disrupted my concentration
I said fuck it and lost my patience
They all woke up from sedation
Ain't none of you Dr. Dre, so then what is it got you thinkin'
You can fuck with this operation?!
(Aftermath) Still running hip-hop amazin'
I'm still pluggin' along
No need for an assumption, here's confirmation
I'm up for the long duration
I'm just looking for something to walk away with
Some pocket change and a little integrity
Though I'll probably be jumpin' across the stage
'Til I'm fuckin' Madonna's age and
Stuck in an awkward place in my life
But I shit you not like I'm plugged up with constipation
That day will come
Before I finally stumble upon some lady that's…

Right for me, (that will) change me
Rearrange my head to be
Just right for you and me
Don't laugh, please listen to me

And I started from the bottom
Like a snowman—ground-up
Like round chuck, and still put hands on you
Stayin' wound up is how I spend time (get it?)
Sucker free, confidence high
Such a breeze when I pen rhymes
I just got that air about me like wind chimes (yeah)
Another day in the life (uh)
Used to have to scrape to get by (yeah)
Now my community's gated and I
Made it and my neighbors say hi (say hi)
I'm givin' 'em pounds, I'm upscale now
Guess it means I'm way in the sky (way in the sky)
But I still remember the days of
Minimum wage for general labor
Welfare recipient since a minor
Look how government assistance has made ya!
Adversity, if at first you don't succeed
Put your temper to more use
'Cause bein' broke's a poor excuse
That should only give you more fuel
Show 'em why you're you
So close, God, it's like I almost got it
But close only counts in time, bombs and horseshoes
So I Unabomb shit—tick, tick, tick—no remorse, pew!
Screw it, I'm lit, and that attitude I blew up on quick
That's why they call me firecracker
I grew up on WIC—wick, wick, wick—with a short fuse
I got some important news to report to
Anyone who thought I was done: nah bitch, not quite
Spotlight's back on, got my faith, where's yours?

Do you still believe in me?
Didn't I give everything I had to give you to make you see?
I'll never forget if you turn your back on me now
And walk out, I will never let you live it down
I'll never quit, do you still believe in me?

Man, I know sometimes
These thoughts can be harsh and cold as ice
To me they're just ink blots
I just fling 'em like slingshots and so precise
So you might wanna think it over twice (yeah)
When you retards can roll the dice
But beef will at least cost you your career
'Cause even my cheap shots are overpriced
But this middle finger's free as a bird
Nuke warhead at birth, hugest forehead on Earth
Too short for the verse, studied his formula, learned
How to incorporate a curse
Point it towards corporate America
Stick a fork in and turn
'Cause four-letter words are more better heard
The world force-fed a turd to me, you're getting yours
But sometimes I overdo it, but I just get so into it
I was there consolin' you when no one knew it
When your situation showed no improvement
I was that door, you walked over to it
I'm the light at the end of the tunnel
So people are always lookin' to me as they're goin' through it
When that tunnel vision is unclear
Shit becomes too much to bear
Since "Cleanin' Out My Closet"
When I was havin' trouble with the snare
I'm that unrealistic prayer answered
And I'ma get you jacked up like you're tryna fix a flat, uh
When you struggle with despair
That double-fisted, bare-knuckles coupled with this pair
Of nuts I'm cuppin', I am your fuck-it switch, nothin' can compare

Do you still believe in me?
Didn't I give everything I had to give you to make you see?
I'll never forget if you turn your back on me now
And walk out, I will never let you live it down
I'll never quit, do you still believe in me?

Started from the bottom like a snowman
Oh man, put that in your corncob pipe and smoke that
But my battery's low, I'ma need a boost to my pack
And I know that I always got Proof at my back
I called you "Proof" because I knew for a fact
My ace in the hole, homie, I'm callin' on you
'Cause I think I'm slowly startin' to lose faith in it, so
Give me that apron and mo–
–tivation to go, Hussein with the flow
Fake fans that are two-faced at the show
Let heartbeats loop, produce hate in my soul
Layin' vocals two days in a row
True statement, hate to go down this road
But there's only one route to cross this bridge
So I walk in this bitch with loose change
'Cause all my dues paid, but this booth's takin' its toll
But it's never too late to start a new beginnin'
That goes for you too, so what the fuck you gon' do?
Use the tools you're given!
Or you're gon' use the cards you're dealt
As an excuse for you to not do shit with 'em?
I used to play the loser/victim
'Til I saw the way Proof was driven
I found my vehicle and I haven't ran out of gas yet
And when they stacked decks, turn handicaps into assets
Fanny packs, hourglasses
If time was on my side, I'd still have none to waste
Man, in my younger days
That dream was so much fun to chase
It's like I'd run in place
While this shit dangled in front of my face
But how do you keep up the pace
And the hunger pangs once you've won the race?
When that dual exhaust is coolin' off
'Cause you don't got nothin' left to prove at all
'Cause you done already hit 'em with the coup de grâce
Still you feel the need to go full tilt
That Bruce Willis, that Blue Steel, that true skill
When that wheel's loose, I won't lose will
Do you still believe?

Instinctive nature to bring the anguish (Yeah)
To the English language
With this ink, you haters get rode on like a piece of paper
This rap shit got me travelin' place to place
You barely leave your house
'Cause you're always stuck at your pad, it's stationary
Yeah, that's why when I brainstorm, gotta write it out
Simon Cowell of rhymin' foul, that's why you sound so shook
Wire bound notebook got tied around your throat
Hook it inside your mouth, go—hruh
That's what it's like when the mic is out
'Cause I'm tearin' at your flesh with it
'Til your larynx and neck are split
With these lyrics, weapons, expert with
Like hair extensions, extra clips
And you're scared to effin' death of it
Bitch, you're starin' at a legend that
In a pair of Skechers, sweatshirt ripped
And hoodie black, should be strapped
To a chair or stretcher, electric, swear on every record, bitch
Finger so high in the air, I'll bet your senses flip
Like a barometric pressure switch
Carin' less who I offend with this
I'm at your neck like Pez dispense
Go 'head, spit your flow, bitch!

I'm at your throat like Chloraseptic, 'septic
And you got strep, I'm too complex with it, 'plex with it
This shit I wrote is on some next shit, next shit
I'm at your throat, I'm feelin' reckless, reckless, yeah

And I'll take a hundred of you, hundred of you
All at once like I had nothin' to lose, what can I do?
My appetite for destruction is loose, destruction is loose
And all it wants is to have somethin' to chew
Somethin' to chew, somethin' to chew

Yeah, uh (Ha ha), and still conjoined at
The hip with hop, still on point and poignant
Skilled as Floyd is
In this field, and still no filter, boy
I'll put you in your place (Yeah) like a realtor, boy
You still ain't in the buildin', boy
I will destroy shit, even as I build it
Get the drill bit, pen is filled with poison
Which is the source, easy to still pinpoint it
(Like what?) Like a real thin joint it
(What?) Comes on Quilted Northern
(And what?) In a built-in toilet
(Yeah) Bitch, I told you I'm a dog (Woof)
I wouldn't heal with ointment
Way I'm kickin' these fairies' tails
Should write a children's storybook (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Million voices in my head
But still get a little bit of thrill and some real enjoyment
(Off what?) Off the feel of going in
(Like?) Like your bitch when she gives me brain
Like she thinks I'm dumb
Grabs the crown of my dick and blows me to kingdom come
'Til I feel anointed
She makes iller noises
When she's with me, must be from the Windy City, uh
Pretty apparent, she's a MILF when blowin' me
'Cause I conned her into
Rippin' the condom in two (Woo!)
Dick is a bargainin' tool
Now I'm gettin' blew like Klonopins, Rude Jude
I go there, you wouldn't
Well, I still have a few views in common with you
Just not YouTube, 'cause…

I'm at your throat like Chloraseptic, 'septic
And you got strep, I'm too complex with it, 'plex with it
This shit I wrote is on some next shit, next shit
I'm at your throat, I'm feelin' reckless, reckless, yeah (bitch)

You're a has-been
That has been the case since back when
You last went and threw your hat in the race
You've been trash (Bitch!)
Stick your raps in the trash bin
Or end up in my next rhyme
You're a fuckboy, so next time
It's gonna be heads flyin' like Dez Bryant
With a TEC-9 against Rex Ryan (Yeah!)
Now watch me set it like correct time
All you get is sloppy seconds like a Timex, I
Clock rejects into the next life
Talking reckless, but it's just my
Strongest suit, but you can get my Colombian necktie
Prostitute, just climb in the Humvee and let's ride
Why you hitching at night?
I put an end to your life, sex crime
Kidding aside, insidious vibe
Girl, you know you got the prettiest eyes
But all you're getting is bribed
Any old lie to try to get you inside
Then we gon' end up spending the night
And I'm skinning your hide like an Indian tribe
What kind of nut drives a Budweiser truck
Finds a slut, tries to surprise her, cuffs, ties her up
Binds up, cuts, slices her twice?
But the muff diver must just like it rough
Fuck right in her vagina, blood
Flies up on the visor, like a geyser, uh
(Music, please!) Enthusiast of the roofie
Goal is to get a floozy inside the Jacuzzi
And have a loosey-goosey as Cool C is with an Uzi
But I am to rap what blue jeans mean to Bruce Springsteen
Glued we be, I'm truTV, you're too PG
I'm Schoolly D, you're Spoonie Gee!
No diss there, just notice there
Are no similarities that we share
Besides the fact we breathe air
Happily married to rap and I'm glad that we buried
The hatchet and patched it up
Now I'm back to ratchet up my attack
And I'm at your motherfuckin' throat like—

—throat like Chloraseptic, 'septic
And you got strep, I'm too complex with it, 'plex with it
This shit I wrote is on some next shit, next shit
I'm at your throat, I'm feelin' reckless, reckless, yeah

And I'll take a hundred of you, hundred of you
All at once like I had nothin' to lose, what can I do?
My appetite for destruction is loose, destruction is loose
And all it wants is to have somethin' to chew
Somethin' to chew, somethin' to chew

(Fack) Okay
(Fack) How do I say this?
(Fack, fack, fack)
Last year didn't work out so well for me
(Fack, fack, fack) (fack last year)
(Fack) (Last year can eat a dick!)
2018, well (fack, fack)

Yeah, I'm a fuckin' kamikaze crashin' into everything
You beat me, Islamic Nazi, that means there is no such thing
I've been goin' for your jugular since Craig G "Duck Alert"
Wedgie in my underwear, the whole bedsheet and the comforter
Stuck up in my rectal crack, kiss my disrespectful ass
I'll ride through your cul-de-sac
Window cracked, bumpin' your reference tracks
You-you collaborative effort rap, I-I have never said his raps
O-overstayed my welcome, stepped in crap
And ruined your welcome mat
So spit that shit from the heart, you didn't write like you wrote it
While I teabag the microphone 'cause I go nuts on it
Like a fighter jet lined with explosives that'll strike any moment
Headed right at opponents and I'm the fuckin' pilot that flown it
I'm 'bout to—

Smash into everyone, crash into everything
Back and I've just begun, "FACK" 2017
Fack, fack on everyone
Fack, fack on everyone
Fack, fack on everyone
I'm a Kamikaze, gonna
Smash into everyone, crash like an F-15
Damage already done, y'all shoulda let me be
Fack, fack on everyone
Fack, fack on everyone
Fack, fack on everyone
I'm a Kamikaze, gonna

I turned to rap 'cause it made me feel tough when I wasn't (wasn't)
From the moment I heard rappers cussin', I was in (was in)
Which is why I identify with the guy
Who I was invented by, Dre's Frankenstein
Energized like a nine volt, ice cold
Like Snake Eyes, twice in a row on a dice roll
But if the only reason I blowed is 'cause I'm white though
Why don't every other white rapper sell what I sold? (ooh)
Kamikaze pilot, I wrote my suicide note
Here come the guys in white coats tryin' to stop me
'Fore I jump behind the controls and try to fly into foes
'Cause I'm takin' y'all with me when I go cyclone
I don't think this typhoon's lettin' up any time soon, here I go
Eyes closed, blindfolded, I'm 'bout to—

Smash into everyone, crash into everything
Back and I've just begun, "FACK" 2017
Fack, fack on everyone
Fack, fack on everyone
Fack, fack on everyone
I'm a Kamikaze, gonna
Smash into everyone, crash like an F-15
Damage already done, y'all should've let me be
Fack, fack on everyone
Fack, fack on everyone
Fack, fack on everyone
I'm a Kamikaze, gonna

Smash
Kamikaze, kamikaze
Kamikaze, kamikaze, kami-kamikaze
Take a look at what I've done

I heard your freestyle on Shade 45, that shit was embarrassing
There is no way we ever air that shit again, I guarantee that
Wait that shit was so ass it's somethin' we wouldn't dare re-air it
Shit's embarrassing, as me rear-ending Tara Reid bare
In my therapy chair, my dick is the hair length of Cher
Each nut is the chair width of an Acorn stairlift beware of me
Lyrically I'm terrible, better get your lyrics prepared
Richard Ramirez is here, serial killin' every beat there is

Wait, wait, got the eeriest feelin'
Somethin' evil is lurkin', I'm no conspiracy theorist
But somethin' here is a foot—oh yeah, it's my dick
Get the measuring stick (what?), twelve inches of wood
Wait, but I've been goin' for your jugular since Craig G Duck Alert
And I've come to pay respects
'Cause if you sleep you're fucked—other words, you get laid to rest
And I hope your butt is hurt
Put me on a track, I go cray on it like a color book
You got some views, but you're still below me
Mine are higher, so when you compare our views, you get overlooked
And I don't say the hook unless I wrote the hook
And now I'm just freestylin' in the vocal booth
And you know I've always spoke the truth
You're lyin' through your teeth so much you broke a tooth
And it ain't somethin' I need a phone to do
When I say I can't wait 'til I get ahold of you
And I don't know what I'm s'posed to do
Line up the rappers, take my pic like a photo shoot

Ugh, you're a monster

I can swallow a bottle of alcohol and I'll feel like Godzilla
Better hit the deck like the card dealer
My whole squad's in here, walking around the party
A cross between a zombie apocalypse and B-Bobby "The
Brain" Heenan which is probably the
Same reason I wrestle with mania
Shady's in this bitch, I'm posse'd up
Consider it to cross me a costly mistake
If they sleepin' on me, the hoes better get insomnia
ADHD, Hydroxycut
Pass the Courvoisier (Hey, hey)
In AA with an AK, melee, finna set it like a playdate
Better vacate, retreat like a vacay, mayday
This beat is cray-cray, Ray J, H-A-H-A-H-A
Laughing all the way to the bank, I spray flames
They cannot tame or placate the (Ayy)

Monster
You get in my way, I'ma feed you to the monster, yeah
I'm normal during the day, but at night, turn to a monster, yeah
When the moon shines like Ice Road Truckers
I look like a villain outta those blockbusters
(Godzilla, fire spitter), monster
Blood on the dance floor, and on the Louis V carpet
(Fire, Godzilla, fire), monster
Blood on the dance floor, and on the Louis V carpet

I'm just a product of Slick Rick and Onyx, told 'em lick the balls
Had 'em just appalled did so many things that pissed 'em off
It's impossible to list 'em all
And in the midst of all this
I'm in a mental hospital with a crystal ball
Tryna see, will I still be like this tomorrow?
Risperdal, voices whisper
My fist is balled back up against the wall, pencil drawn
This is just the song to go ballistic on
You just pulled a pistol on a guy with a missile launcher
I'm just a Loch Ness, the mythological
Quick to tell a bitch screw off like a fifth of Vodka
When you twist the top of the bottle, I'm a

Monster
You get in my way, I'ma feed you to the monster (Yeah)
I'm normal during the day, but at night, turn to a monster (Yeah)
When the moon shines like Ice Road Truckers
I look like a villain outta those blockbusters
(Godzilla, fire spitter), monster
Blood on the dance floor, and on the Louis V carpet
(Fire, Godzilla, fire), monster
Blood on the dance floor, and on the Louis V carpet

If you never gave a damn, raise your hand
'Cause I'm about to set trip, vacation plans
I'm on point like my index is, so all you will ever get is
The motherfuckin' finger (Finger), prostate exam ('Xam)
How can I have all these fans and perspire?
Like a liar's pants, I'm on fire
And I got no plans to retire and I'm still the man you admire
These chicks are spazzin' out, I only get more handsome and flyer
I got 'em passin' out like what you do when you hand someone flyers
And what goes around comes around just like the blades on the chainsaw
'Cause I caught the flack, but my dollars stacked right off the bat like a baseball
Like Kid Ink, bitch, I got them racks with so much ease that they call me Diddy
'Cause I make bands and I call getting cheese a cakewalk (Cheesecake, yeah)
Bitch, I'm a player, I'm too motherfuckin' stingy for Cher
Won't even lend you an ear, ain't even pretending to care
But I tell a bitch I'll marry her if she'll bury her
Face in my genital area, the original Richard Ramirez
Cristhian Rivera, 'cause my lyrics never sit well
So they wanna give me the chair
Like a paraplegic, and it's scary, call it Hari Kari
'Cause every Tom and Dick
And Harry carry a Merriam motherfuckin' dictionary
On 'em swearing up and down, they can spit, this shit's hilarious
It's time to put these bitches in the obituary column
We wouldn't see eye to eye with a staring problem
Get the shaft like a steering column (Monster)
Trigger happy, pack heat, but it's black ink
Evil half of the Bad Meets
Evil, that means take a back seat
Take it back to Fat Beats with a maxi, single
Look at my rap sheet, what attracts these people
Is my 'Gangsta Bitch' like Apache with a catchy jingle
I stack chips, you barely got a half-eaten Cheeto
Fill 'em with the venom and eliminate 'em
Other words, I Minute Maid 'em
I don't wanna hurt 'em, but I did, I'm in a fit of rage
I'm murderin' again, nobody will evade
I'm finna kill 'em and dump all their fuckin' bodies in the lake
Obliterating everything, incinerate a renegade
I'm here to make anybody who want it with the pen afraid
But don't nobody want it, but they're gonna get it anyway
'Cause I'm beginnin' to feel like I'm mentally ill
I'm Attila, kill or be killed, I'm a killer bee, the vanilla gorilla
You're bringin' the killer within me outta me
You don't wanna be the enemy of the demon who entered me
Or be on the receivin' end of me, what stupidity it'd be
Every bit of me's the epitome of a spitter
When I'm in the vicinity, motherfucker, you better duck
Or you finna be dead the minute you run into me
A hundred percent of you is a fifth of a percent of me
I'm 'bout to fuckin' finish you, bitch, I'm unfadable
You wanna battle, I'm available, I'm blowing up like an inflatable
I'm undebatable, I'm unavoidable, I'm unevadable
I'm on the toilet bowl
I got a trailer full of money and I'm paid in full
I'm not afraid to pull a—

Man, stop
Look what I'm plannin', haha

I don't wanna be alone, I don't wanna be
I don't wanna be alone in the darkness
I don't wanna be alone in the darkness
I don't wanna be alone in the darkness anymore
(Hello darkness, my old friend)

Here I am, alone again
Can't get out of this hole I'm in
It's like the walls are closin' in
You can't help me, no one can
I can feel these curtains closin'
I go to open 'em
But something pulls 'em closed again
(Hello darkness, my old friend)
Feels like I'm loathing in Las Vegas
Haven't got the vaguest why I'm so lost
But I'd make you this small wager
If I bet you, I'll be in tomorrow's paper
Who would the odds favor?
(Hello darkness, my old friend)
I'm so much like my father, you would think that I knew him
I keep pacin' this room Valium
Then chase it with booze, one little taste it'll do
Maybe I'll take it and snooze, then tear up the stage in a few
(Hello, darkness, my old friend)
Fuck the Colt 45, I'ma need somethin' stronger
If I pop any caps, it better be off of vodka
Round after round after round, I'm gettin' loaded
That's a lot of shots, huh? (double entendre)
(Hello darkness, my old friend)

And I don't wanna be alone in the darkness
I don't wanna be alone in the darkness
I don't wanna be alone in the darkness anymore
(Hello darkness, my old friend)

Now I'm starin' at the room service menu off a Benzo
I can hear the music continue to crescendo
I can see the whole fuckin' venue from my window
That's when you know you're schizo
(Hello darkness, my old friend)
'Cause I keep peekin' out the curtain from the hotel
The music is so loud, but it's almost as though
I don't hear no sound, I should get ready for the show now
Wait is this the whole crowd? I thought this shit was sold out
(Hello darkness, my old friend)
But it's only the opening act, it's early, don't overreact
Then something told me relax and just hope for the show to be packed
Don't wanna hit the stage before they fill each row to the max
'Cause that'd be totally wacked, you can't murder a show nobody's at
(Hello, darkness, my old friend)
But what if nobody shows?
Panic mode 'bout to snap and go motherfuckin' wacko at any second
'Bout to cancel the show, just as fans below rush the entrance
Plan is a go to wreck shit, cameras in all directions
(Hello, darkness, my old friend)
The press is about to go ape shit bananas on all the networks
Commando with extra clips, I got ammo for all the hecklers
I'm armed to the teeth, another Valium fall off the bed
Hit the ground and crawl to the dresser
Alcohol on my breath as I reach for the scope
I'm blackin' out, I'm all out of meds
With them benzodiazepines gone
Now it's just magazines sprawled out on the floor
Fuck the media, I'm goin' all out, this is war
(Hello darkness, my old friend)

I don't wanna be alone in the darkness
I don't wanna be alone in the darkness
I don't wanna be alone in the darkness anymore
(Hello, darkness, my old friend)

People start to show up, time to start the show up
It's 10:05 PM and the curtain starts to go up
And I'm already sweatin' but I'm locked and loaded
For rapid fire spittin' for all the concert-goers
Scopes for sniper vision, surprise from out of nowhere
As I slide the clip in from inside the hotel
Leanin' out the window, going Keyser Söze
Finger on the trigger, but I'm a licensed owner
With no prior convictions, so law says sky's the limit
So my supply's infinite, strapped like I'm a soldier
Got 'em hopping over walls and climbing fences
Some of them John Travolta, staying alive by inches
(Hello, darkness, my old friend)
Cops are knockin', oh, fuck, thought I blocked the entrance
Guess show time is over no suicide note
Just a note for target distance
But if you'd like to know the reason why I did this
You'll never find a motive, truth is I have no idea
I am just as stumped, no signs of mental illness
Just tryin' to show ya the reason why we're so fucked
'Cause by the time it's over, won't make the slightest difference
(Hello darkness, my old friend)

I don't wanna be alone in the darkness
I don't wanna be alone in the darkness
I don't wanna be alone in the darkness anymore
(Hello darkness, my old friend)

Ricky Racks
For what it's worth
You were a slut at birth
If the world had a dick
You'd fuck the Earth
I tried to get over you
It doesn't work
You're still a cunt
I'm still a fucking jerk

Same as it ever was, yeah
Say it'll change but it never does
Ain't gonna ever 'cause
You're the cause of my pain and the medicine
Never met someone who played games with my head as much
Fate tethered us together like two felons
Must've fell in love with skeletons
Everyone's got 'em, thought that you were Cinderella but (Yeah)
Feels like I slept with the (Uh) wicked stepmother
But how the hell am I
Still in love with the motherfucking chick there's at least a million of
They say love the one you with
But this shit is killing us
Our love's on some other shit
I'm a glutton for punishment
You're the gloves, I'm the punching mitts
It's above and beyond us
Cuffing, I'm shoving the girl I love inside of an oven
If I catch you sucking another dick
You better unsuck it, you snuck in the crib and tried to jump under the covers again
Why am I tucking you in?
Probably 'cause

I gotta tell myself another lie
'Cause that's what helps to get me by
'Cause I'm in Hell
This is my goodbye, farewell

Wanna hold you, wanna choke you, wanna love you
Wanna hate you, wanna kill you, wanna hurt you
Wanna heal you, yeah
Wanna lose you, keep you, bruise you
Beat, abuse you, treat you mutual
It's juvenile, delusional, as usual
You're beautiful, I'm average (Woo)
I'm brutal, you're a savage
My ride or die chick who's always cruising for a bruising
Yeah, it's kinda like we're tryna light a dynamite stick
Though we might get along like shit
Fight, hit, bite, spit, unite, split
Yeah, you're awful, but you're mine
And they say love is blind, we see each other fine
But it's no wonder, I'm (Yeah) the only one you'll find (Uh)
To put up with your shit (What?), I need a plumber line (Yeah)
But nothing comes to mind (Nah) besides the number 90 (No)
'Cause since '06 you flipped my fucking life, upside down
Now the sky's ground, look at my frown, it's a smile now
Look at my mouth, it's my eyebrows, make it rain upwards
We're on that ninth cloud, two insane lovebirds
I should fly south, 'cause man am I great, ain't lyin' to myself
But I'm just plain stubborn, I'm Audi five thou'
But this is my house, bitch, you get out
Then we duke it out, then it dies down
Then we say, "Fuck it", cry our eyes out
Then...

I gotta tell myself another lie
'Cause that's what helps to get me by
'Cause I'm in Hell
This is my goodbye, farewell

This relationship is all that it's cracked up to be
Never lack lust in that 'cause we act nuts
'Cause that's what attracts us
Trick you with a back rub
Tell you to relax then dump your ass in the bathtub (Haha)
Yeah, now that's love, may sound pathetic
But fuck the world 'cause they out to get us
I love you but I won't exchange vows
Hey now, don't get carried away
No way I'll get married, it'll take a rain cloud to wed us
Yeah, but we're so insane 'bout each other
May take the same route and way out as Junior Seau
Break out Berettas, lay down in bed and blow our brains out together
Who knows how it's gonna play out?
Or whether death's what our ending will be
One of us shot in the back while attempting to flee
But I'll go to bat for you, defending your honor
Yeah, no contingency fees, something we're not, nah
We're not pretending to beef, don't cost a penny to be with me
Time we're spending is free, we could be broke as a joke
Won't make a difference to me, don't have to give me a thing
Could've been a 50 cent ring from out of a vending machine
Love unconditionally, there's no other fish in the sea
Guess I'm a prisoner, see, addiction is a disease

I gotta tell myself another lie
'Cause that's what helps to get me by
'Cause I'm in Hell
This is my goodbye, farewell

Love you girl, do you feel the same?
I don't wanna play games, no games, ah
You're the only one that can out my flame
Baby, just play it straight, straight, no games, ah
